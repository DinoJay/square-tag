The novel is famous: Nietzsche considered it to be one of the four greatest works of German literature. Today, it is unreadable. It’s packed with information about geology, botany, zoology, the crafts, painting, and architecture; but this gigantic, uplifting encyclopedia virtually leaves out man himself, and his situation.

"I was","https://www.diigo.com/item/note/5j1yj/vn9w","no_tag","","","Highlight:<p>I was about to watch 'Once upon a Time in America' yesterday evening only to be demotivated by the sheer running time and my own tiredness. But it reminded me again of the magic of italian cinema scores. For Sergio Leone the story&nbsp;and dialogues were only side aspects. The real magic is in the images which are as still and timeless <em class=""diigoHighlight id_a539a1472bfb2782dd45398434d2ae65 type_0 yellow"">&nbsp;but also full of meaning laden symbol and&nbsp; views into to the inner struggle of the characters . With the orchestra scores of Ennio Morricone a life of its own unfolds on the screen</em></p>
<div class=""diigoIcon id_a539a1472bfb2782dd45398434d2ae65 type_9 TextIcon yellow"" style=""bottom: 0px;"" title="""">&nbsp;</div>
<p>which has enough similarities with the real world to find a personal connection but it represents also something otherworldly, something that existed in another timeline in the mind of the cineaste.&nbsp;No discussion that the&nbsp;movies of Sergio Leone are masterpieces but he was not the only one. I'm not an expert but there are other filmmakers from italy who deservers to be mentioned such as .... Sometimes, their movies were not that great&nbsp;because followed the b-movie&nbsp;genre due to financial restrictions but the soundtracks were often a goody bag of epic jazz funk grooves&nbsp;composed for an orchestra. I'm a big fan of Piero Umiliani, who composed the world famous 'manana' but also did the equally genius 'Continente Nero' which reminds me of&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.discogs.com/artist/11648/tracks"">Johnny Hammond</a>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.discogs.com/release/3440787"">Los Conquistadores Chocolates</a>. famously played in the loft by David Mancuso. Another composer&nbsp;<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Piero Piccioni&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;scored the film 'Camille 2000' which I'm super proud to be the owner of the soundtrack. I have not watched the movie yet but the cover art is without comparison a masterpiece of cornyness. Nobody else than&nbsp;Quentin Tarantino pays as much hommage in his films.&nbsp; For more info check out the foreword of the book 'once upon a time in the west' and all his movies</p>
<p>&nbsp;Unfortunately, I just started my journey to collect film scores. That's why I don't have all the classics to play but I have some other&nbsp;art film soundtracks. We play a lot of 'Johanna Billing' who direct her films as social happenings where she actually does not direct the entire process of creation. For example in 'Muelheim jazz session', she creates artificially a traffic jam in the rural area of muehlheim. To pass time&nbsp;people 'spontaneously start to busy themselves; eating fruit, doing crosswords, play around with their dogs in the fields and talking'. (<a href=""http://johannabilling.com/pulheim-jam-session-2015-hd-2240-loop/"">http://johannabilling.com/pulheim-jam-session-2015-hd-2240-loop/</a>)</p>

"Disco for old p","https://www.diigo.com/item/note/5j1yj/dbff9d9c","kitchenfunk","","","Highlight:<p>Disco for old people.<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />I'm Jan 30 years old, born in 88 my colleague is 29 born one year later. We like music sometimes too much. We listen to it while fighting with our Phd topics. Our days are spent&nbsp; by digging through the vast world of music on the internet trying to find the one hidden gem. On other days we even eat from it and prepare a radio show. This is what you can witness right now.</p>
<p>This is the first post to commemorate our radio show which happens monthly on xlair radio. Don't expect anything professional. We are bloody amateurs without a real agenda except for&nbsp;the deep conviction to spread&nbsp;our fascination for music which comes straight from&nbsp;the heart.<br /><br />Our first topic from our analogue music cuisine is Disco which is really something special for me because it helped through a lot of&nbsp;difficult moments in my youth when growing up in some rural area in Germany. In the beginning, disco was not more than a word floating around in the media like an old car nobody wants to drive anymore.&nbsp; It had the same smell as the seats which were old, dusty, moist and too soft. The echos of that music you could still find in some antiquated television shows&nbsp; which used it as&nbsp;backing track&nbsp;for some&nbsp;poorly executed action scenes. In record stores disco music was always put in the lower shelves which were hard to reach and sold for nothing more than a few euros.</p>
<p>Abba was disco as much as the Begees or John Travolta. Your parents were disco and Rock 'n' Roll was it definitely not.&nbsp; So, in short Disco sucked. But now this genre&nbsp; is celebrating a&nbsp;comeback and paradoxically enough. I feel a bit old to explain you why. When going into clubs , I often feel touched to hear all these tracks I listened alone in my room getting finally&nbsp;aired in public. I can't even fully enjoy it because it seems so surreal. Young&nbsp;people around me crying to Donna Summer or Silvester I really ask myself&nbsp; how do they got into that? The idea of the dancefloor as a space&nbsp;to&nbsp; be free is was&nbsp;the big dream for a generation of young dancers. It did not matter if you are rich or poor, black or white, gay or straight. In the repetition the beat people experienced freedom perhaps for the first time in their life. But the disco movement has failed just as the hippies or punks did . Its early idealism was soon to be caught by reality. Big Money, drug addiction sex work and AIDS found their way to the dancefloor.&nbsp;<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Young people today don't realize this, they were never part of&nbsp;</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">the</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> scene. The only thing they remember are the songs, these long extended percussive workouts full of funk, soul and the cry for freedom. On Youtube, some disco tracks have more than 1 million plays which is impressive because they&nbsp;are tools for djs not meant to be played on a smartphone with these little ear plugs.&nbsp;Some people say that disco is dead because it is decontextualized and reappropriated from its origin which was marginal, black and gay, thereby losing its soul and serving the big money machine of capitalism. Other say that disco is still alive and kicking after all these years and creates a narrative for artists, club goers and listeners who are in need of faith.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">As life is, the matter is complicated. But when I'm alone in my room watching the stars disco kicks my ass and frees my mind. It makes me move forward and shows me what's possible in life.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">and not on a smartphone on the&nbsp; never meant to reach so many people. </span></p>
<p>Disco is dead or better it is undead</p>
<p>members of that scene , we just collected the crumbs of information found on the internet and formed our own narrative.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Something, you don't really find&nbsp; on the modern dancefloor</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the following decades it was proven that the dancefloor is as much shit as our society.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br /><br /><br />When I started to buy records, it was the stuff everybody did during that time. Tech house minimal, or some sort of derivations of daft punk. But disco was always there in form of samples. I listened to these funky guitar licks, bass lines or vocal snippets without really noticing and kept my attention until I started to dig into it<br /><br />Despite that fact disco is the DNA of all modern dance music.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br />I bought Minimal tech house like anybody else<br /><br />&nbsp;Do alz bought these records. But still glimpses from the seventies were sampled. So, I heard it<br /><br />When I grew up disco was for old ppl. <br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;I got into disco 10 years ago.<br /><br />.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />were doing a radio show in a student radio and we are probably one of the more older fellows in the team&nbsp;</p>

  <span class=""authorOrTitle"">
    Richard P. Feynman</span>
Highlight:“Fall in love with some activity, and do it! Nobody ever figures out what life is all about, and it doesn't matter. Explore the world. Nearly everything is really interesting if you go into it deeply enough. Work as hard and as much as you want to on the things you like to do the best. Don't think about what you want to be, but what you want to do. Keep up some kind of a minimum with other things so that society doesn't stop you from doing anything at all.”

Everything we have done in the last 5 years&nbsp; was without the other and the future looks quite similar. We have two options <br>We could just flush our minds completely, go on and cope with all the future challenges yet to come. Or we could desperately hang on past pleasures and try to recreate them with the same or different persons. Like many other human I tried to do option 2 and I was doomed to fail. It was just to easy to hold on stupid beliefs about the world and try realize my dreams with a sledgehammer instead of starting all over again with a fresh mind. But let's be honest. We can't forget what happened in our life. At any given moment our decision making is informed by our memories not only on an individual level but also social and even evolutionary. Reality is like an echo chamber. Its sound waves make no difference between space and time. They are all over the place . It's hard to point to the source .The art is to face the chaos with courage and keep the head straight.<br>Under these considerations I think it's never to ask for an update ;-)<br><br>______ ______ ______&nbsp;<br><br>You can fill in the blanks with any question you like to answer because I don't know what to ask anymore. I think we share preference not to write about any worldly stuff such as career, physical health or social relationships if they don't cause any significant change of our mental world. That's why I spare you most of my girl stories and my daily office life. All I can say that my life is somehow more settled now. I try to focus on my interests instead of any&nbsp; short term pleasure such as going out and drinking too much. <br>Richard P Feynman put it really nicely what I'm trying to do.&nbsp;<br><br>

"Hey Caro,Natürl","https://www.diigo.com/item/note/5j1yj/d100f9f4","","","","Highlight:Hey Caro,<br><br>Natürlich bin ich noch im Regen herumstolziert und habe den nassen Rauch von Ixelles inhaliert. Auf einer feuchten Parkbank sammelte ich schliesslich meine Gedanken und schreibe dir nun diese Zeilen: <br><br>Unser kleines Rendezvous verlief leider ein bisschen flacher als ich erwartet. Als du mich gefragt hast, was es denn so viel zu erzählen gibt, hätte ich dir eigentlich sagen sollen: <br><br>Alles, l'univers entière, how I see the world from my isolated lighthouse and how much I would like to share this world view with you. Frankly speaking, I really missed you in the two weeks we didn't see each other. But probably that feeling wasn't really mutual. <br><br>Denn es hat nicht wirklich klickgemacht. Der nasse Regen und der kalte Wind schien alles zu unterdrücken. Wie gerne hätte ich dir meine Geschichten über house, disco, New York und unerwiderte liebe erzählt. Und wie daraus Hoffnung für ein ganze Generation von marginalisierten Jugendlichen wurde. Diesen Traum traeume ich noch immer. Wo sind die Freiräume in der nie stoppenden Maschinerie? Ich bin immer noch auf der Suche und ich will mich nicht ergeben. Der house dream war nie für mich, einen weissen wohlhabenden angry young man aber er spendet Hoffnung. Wenn ich darüber spreche, schliesst sich mein Hals jedes Mal ein bisschen zusammen weil darin meine ganze Überzeugung aber auch Aggression mitschwingt. Das ist meine Kanal worüber ich liebe zu gedenken finde. Und ich dachte, wir könnten diesen Kanal teilen. Aber mit der Zeit komme ich zur Überzeugung, dass das ein Irrglauben war. Ein Nachtfalter, den man kurz in der Nacht aufblitzen sieht, aber dann abrupt abstürzt. Seine Bewegung war so schnell, das man garnicht sicher ist, ob da überhaupt was war. So, fühlt es sich ein bisschen mit dir an.<br><br>&nbsp;I can see that you have so many different dreams going into so many different directions. You do everything at once, you are active and determined and I'm just the lonely dreamer who I always was which isn't a bad thing. We are just different and sometimes it's hard to understand each other.<br><br>Sorry für die ganzen Missverständnisse und meine anderen komischen E-Mails.&nbsp;<br><br>I'm always late to move on but now it's the time<br><br>With love and squalor!<br>Jan

The goals associated with PLEs are multifaceted, with learning and development through play and games being the primary aim. If the curricula of pre-primary and basic education  if  concerned  with  play,  playfulness,  learning  activities  and  the learning  environment,  then  the  goals  and  ideals  are  similar.  Otherwise  the curricula  differ  greatly.  However,  PLEs  can  also  be  used  in  formal  education because users actually make the content.

"Oh Caro, dann v","https://www.diigo.com/item/note/5j1yj/50a547bc","","","","Highlight:<div>Oh Caro, dann viel Erfolg bei allem was dich umhertreibt in Deutschland. Appropos Deutschland, ich habe mir letzens&nbsp; so nen kunst-buch von einem Prof aus Düsseldorf besorgt, der heisst Christian jendreiko und lehrt da an der Kunsthochschule. Darin beschreibt wie er mit seinen Kunst-Aktionen betitelt 12 kosmische Beispiele (Performances, Musik-Installationen) neue Gesellschaftsformen im kleinen erprobt. Der Künstler ist dabei so eine Art uebungsleiter der dem Publikum beispielhaft den Weg in einen neuen befreiten Zustand aufzeigt à la neomarxismus mit ganz viel Frankfurter Schule. Ich dachte mir dabei nur was für ein abgehobener Scheiss. Den einzigen den er damit erleuchtet sind irgendwelche Kunststudenten mit pseudo-existenz-ängsten und zu reichen Eltern.</div><div><br></div><div>Das sind jetzt wieder nur zynische floskeln. Ich würde dir ja gerne erhellenderes schreiben. Mich treibt so viel um, so viel schoenes wie auch abscheuliches. Aber ehrlich gesagt, weiss ich nicht was von meinen leeren Worthülsen ueberhaupt bei dir ankommt. Du lässt dir ja nicht wirklich in die Karten schauen. Deine SMS' sind so nichtssagend wie die Weihnachts-Ansprachen vom Bundespräsidenten. Ich hoffe jedoch, dass wir darüber noch herauskommen, wenn du denn Mal da bist.&nbsp;</div><div>Sorry, damit will ich dir nicht schon wieder gegen den Fuß treten. Aber manchmal braucht man Provokationen um diese alles einlullende Oberflächlichkeit zu zerstören. Im Erwachsenalter ist es echt schwer ungezwungene Beziehungen mit anderen Menschen einzugehen, auch wenn man es so fürchterlich will. Jeder trabt auf seinem eigenen Karrierepfad umher mit den Scheuklappen auf. Alles, was nicht ins Konzept passt oder zu kompliziert ist, wird einfach so umgedeutet, dass es weniger schlimm erscheint und im persönlichen Lebenslauf Sinn ergibt.&nbsp;</div><div>Karriere-technisch steht bei mir jetzt auch die heisse Phase an. Zum nächsten Freitag muss der Prototyp stehen. bis dahin muss ich die ganzen Bugs fixen. Und ich brauche noch ein fertiges Design für topic Maps... und so weiter.<br></div>

Ich glaube, das verstehe ich noch nicht. Für mich persönlich sollte jeder Morgen ein Sonnentag sein an dem alle meine Freunde und Familie mit einem Lächeln am Frühstückstisch&nbsp;auf mich warten. Aber der Event alleine ist dabei garnicht so wichtig. Die Gewissheit, dass man sich nicht alleine aus dem Bett hieven muss, sondern zusammen in den Tag startet, gibt mir die noetige Sicherheit und Stärke um einen weiteren Tag in der freien Wildbahn des Erwachsenseins zu überleben. Ohne die Hoffnung nicht alleine zu sein, könnte ich garnicht in den morgigen Tag schauen. Ich würde sonst in den dunklen Schlund der Ungewissheit starren und mit dem verbinde ich eher Unsicherheit und die Möglichkeit unerwartete Erfahrungen zu machen, die zwar positiv sein können, aber verlangen, dass ich meine Zielsetzung und Erwartungshaltung neu ausrichte. Das will ich aber nicht, denn ich wusste schon bevor ich meine Augen zum ersten Mal aufmachte, was ich im Leben will.<br><br>Aber ich vermute, du verbindest etwas anderes mit Spontanität?

"Italy","https://www.diigo.com/item/note/5j1yj/7e318291","francesca","","","Highlight:<p>There was this girl in my class, another one. She made me dream so big that I thought I could touch her face with my bare imagination.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her hair was thick and brown almost black. It was curly and cut short around her neck which made her look like an actress in a shampoo advertising like the lady who breaks the scissors. Her big and Italian designed glasses were stylish but actually more run down and used when looked at it closely. She had all the features of an Italian girl. But unlike the others she did not push her woman shapes into the foreground and present it like a weapon to win the war of beauty. Her style was full of understatement. So much that she did not seem to care. Sometimes, she even wore jogging pants and her hair piled up to a straw bag.</p>
<p>All these characteristics put together made my my mind flourish like flowers in spring. All my cheesiest and wildest dreams were about to come true.<br />I wanted to dive into her soul and forget myself in a wave of love. When I'll come up, I would tell her the truth about beauty and how much I love her. This would erase all her sorrows and problems and make her content about&nbsp; the world.<br /><br /><br />The next class, i was ripped out of my dreams. her face changed to a wall of cement. My looks were not answered anymore. Her big eyes starred at me with no expression. The only thing I earned was to fuck off and to leave her alone. God knows what she was up to. Probably, I will never know. Lonely, again I spend the rest of the class wondering about my funny life and how I could make sense of it. For god's sake I I knew she was real. It was not just my stupid me making up stories.<br /><br />The third class, she didn't even show up. Perhaps, she had better things to do than facing my odd longing looks. Most likely, she had to work hard for something PhD related. That's all what I know. I stalked her once on Facebook. The few photos I saw were like all the the other profiles. But in her little ordinary gestures I saw subtle expressions of a young woman that charmed me so much that I&nbsp;was all her. But she&nbsp;did not even know.</p>
<p>Two classes later, she was back. And I did not know what to do... The exercise started and we had to do some group work. To my suprise she approached me directly we started talking in our more than basic&nbsp;language about renting appartements. Stunned that she actively chose me as a conversation partner I could actually not really focus on it. For the first time I could closely see&nbsp; her lips and the texture of the skin. I knew that she gave me a lot of empathy in advance with her proactive smile. I had to provide her something to hang on. Otherwise, her face would return back into the dark realm of not giving a fuck. In the moment I found worthwhile idea to impress her I realized that my voice started wavering which happens all too often when speaking with girls. She, seemed also slightly nervous bu<span style=""font-size: 1em;"">t her light smile did not seem to go away.&nbsp;</span></p>

            the labour market, they are not always successful today. In the school year 2005–2006
            in the Netherlands, for instance, about 19% of the pupils in secondary education left
            school without a diploma. The majority of the pupils dropping out of the first classes
            of secondary education came from pre‐vocational education (<span>OCW 2007</span>). The pupil drop‐out issue is an issue, moreover, in not only the Netherlands but
            also all other European countries (<span>Jonassen &amp; Blondal 2005</span>; <span>Herweijer 2008</span>) and the USA as indicated by the many newsletters of the Association for Supervision

"Hey Caro, We di","https://www.diigo.com/item/note/5j1yj/899eb639","","","","Highlight:Hey Caro,&nbsp;<br>What's going on?<br>We didn't hear from each other for a long time. It does feel like an eternity since I have seen you. And it's true, it has been already 4 days. Can you imagine? ;-)<br><br>In this time I, I enjoyed the laziness and comfort&nbsp;of the most beautiful prison on this planet called home. When we return that means me, Nils and Lisa (in order of birth) our parents are super happy to have our family united. Our dad keeps the fireplaces and heating running with wood such that we are not cold and can have hot showers and baths anytime we like to. And my mum is cooking and baking all the time. In the morning we eat real german bread with a selection of and ham cheese which is so manifold that it deserves the word decadent. In the late afternoon we have these long extended lunchs full of everything that normally finish in the early evening with a piece of cake and big pot of coffee. After all this I'm normally so full that I spend the rest of the day with only light work such as reading geeky articles or improving my programming environment.&nbsp;<br><br>No reason to complain I tell to myself but I can't shake off the feeling of being locked in my old home. As much as I make my family happy as less I can think freely. Sometimes it feels more like being in a dream where&nbsp;I'm on a big journey. On a highway I drive a car from one gas station to the other. One station follows the next, they all seem the same with their equipment, service workers, little restaurants and overcooked coffee. Each time I spot a new one I instinctly hope to see some differences and irregularities in their uniformity to be a bit more startled for my way ahead. But there is no. When I stop I'm faced with the same image over and over again. Everything is where it should be. You can't really blame the gas stations for their efficiency. They function as they should be, they give valuable gas to drivers and their vehicles to run faster, higher, stronger and longer. Without them I wouldn't be able to start off my journey. But where does it lead to? Is there any destination? Or am I turning in cycles?<br><br>It seems that driving&nbsp;and childhood never ends at home. Only when I'm in the train back (right now), I wake up and think about the possibilities lying beyond the endless highway. This brings me also back to you ;-). If I'm not mistaken you have a presentation today. Good luck with that!<br><br>Und wie sieht's mit morgen Abend aus? Haste Zeit?<br><br>Cheers,<br>Jan<br><br><br>

<p>That was my plan since last Monday but when the feeling finally came I could not kick it. My mind was was too high, I saw the stars falling from the sky. Too<span style=""font-size: 1em;"">&nbsp;much seemed possible, too little was real. D</span>rinking all night long and shaking your ass off seems like the perfect choice to step over your own personal barriers.<span style=""font-size: 1em;""> But the problem is that booze and night life stimulate you only in the present moment. In the long term your ideas become shallow and blind for reality.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1em;"">I remember lying </span><span style=""font-size: 1em;"">in my bed after the party on Saturday and felt like swimming in electric water. Recollections of the night rushed through me like electroshocks. Images and sounds came over me with a reflective force I could not control. I felt the sensation of creativity but I could not put it down. After two days of drinking I was in deep fatigue. So, I told myself, the next morning I will wake up and write everything down and perhaps send you some of these insightful moments. When the next day came, it was impossible to reconnect, I wrote down a first phrase but then it was all gone. Complete block-out, only goddamn emptiness and guilt - for having no energy and being sad. All the pretty things I wanted to say were blown away. I was dull and dumb - stuck in this alcoholic aquarium where you see no escape and slowly drown. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1em;"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>However, I still managed to get my head out and write something down. Why would somebody care about these inner ramblings? That ain't your business you might say! It's true that I can't explain the<span style=""font-size: 1em;"">&nbsp;terrible mess of human behavior, I'm not even trying to. My own reality is already enough. But nowadays, it's incredible hard to speak with people and share a deeper understanding. Everybody lives in their own closed universe. When a person talks, laughs or looks you barely see the surface of a character. Every impression you make is discussed internally and torn apart in a non stop reflection until there is nothing left. One needs to be inventive to stop this process. I always though<em class=""diigoHighlight id_ff72dbcc0b7458d97403e7528c1bd858 type_0 yellow"">t</em>&nbsp;writing can be the tool to take something back from the past and make it understandable for the people you care about in the here and now. The aim was never to recreate reality and produce truth but to communicate directly from person to person. When you discuss things and fight the ambiguity of life together you will never be alone. That was my idea.</span><br style=""font-size: 1em;"" /><span style=""font-size: 1em;"">&nbsp;</span></p>

For some reason I always drift into a lamenting tone when I try to write you. That must have something to do with our backstory :-). Anyhow, I like to write and I like to write you. How is it to going? I keep on seing friends of yours. They still greet me kindly&nbsp;even when I don't remember their names anymore and I'm too afraid to ask again. In some ways you Belgians are really gentle and polite folks.&nbsp;<br>But why don't I cross you on the streets? Suppose, you are in Brussels and are going to the same kind of parties as everybody goes, I must have hit you. After all, Brussels seems like a rather small town. So either, you left Brussels for a longer period or you are moving in a social sphere I can't imagine. Or both, honestly, I don't know.&nbsp;<br>I have my own stuff going on often don't realize changes in my proximity. For some time now, I was working on my personal website and it keeps growing and growing, a never ending project. I was also planning to write more, do some blogging and some mixtapes. For writing, English becomes more and more my language of choice. It does not feel so boring as German and not so overtly complex as French. By the way, I'm learning Dutch and the similarities to German are striking. It's basically the same language whereas I would not call it by the same name. But I begin to realize that languages are often more an expression of political will rather than a tool for communication. After all, we are all just humans with the same mistakes trying to convey the same message over and over again.<br>

Personally, I find to throw tracks together and really tell a story too hard. Often I actually only care about how to transition from one song the other and thereby often miss the big picture. That's why mixes never actually breathed. The&nbsp; story is always there but hidden in a messy clunk of big hits.uninterested by r cent trend I stick to my palace of house which is luxury but it prevents me to look beyond. Things that are not mixable and stuff like this<br />&nbsp;Moreover, I'm terrible in organizing my record collection. Too many tracks are not played in the right moments. What&nbsp;is recently bought and what by serendipity lies on top of my shelf gets played. . The mixtapes found on David bryne are so wonderfully eclectic and do not fear to touch upon recent trends such as one year after. But what me stroked most was the love mixtape - only love songs together. It showed that the key to a good story is the will. The conviction to pass a message. In the case of love it's rather&nbsp; because the musical form of pop give you hints what to consider as romantic. Of course there are no no love songs. But let's neglect this for a moment. When you listen to 10 successive love songs, it feels like a story even though you listen to banal general lyrics. Why's that the case. Because everybody can relate to it. Music becomes a nostalgic super 8 projector for our memories, dreams and fears. But when you play a bunch of disco house tracks the message goes under because it makes bum bum. Terre Thaemlitz complains about this in a more intellectual form quite often. And that's why I failed in my recent attempts. Because a mixtape<br /><br />Makethe implicit explicit and the explicit implicit.<br /><br />Now is my turn I present you my love mixtape. Favourite tracks from 10 years or so that capture the feeling&nbsp; of a morning after a long night after when you feel that all your hopes wishes for the girl of choice of last&nbsp;night will never be fulfilled. I mean the moment when you hook on a girl with all your romantic energies and decide to tell her the truth. Then, buffled, she says that she has always seen our relationship as platonic. And you shut fuck you my tears are true.<br /><br />UnfortunateIy, this happened far to often for my taste. Fortunately, I'm not the only one. Arguably, loserhood has been already stylized by pop culture.&nbsp; Even in recent house music. But fuck it, we are all feel like losers under the pressure of school, work or sex partners. want give you names, but the traces of the people marked me most</p>

<p>What's up? How is it going? Aww, it's difficult to&nbsp; keep track how people change over time. The problem is to lose contact. We do care a lot about our past fellows but our inner voices are rarely heard.</p>
<p>Trying to fight the process is always a bit tragic. That's why I learned to go with the flow (in the past it was more difficult). People come and people leave. Let's be honest we are replacable. But We are humans and meaning making is one of our favorite hobbies.</p>
<p>touch this matter rather rarely and I don't have so many people of concern which which are far away due to.some reasons and unreachable for synchronous communication and are not dead. To be honest, often I do not want to open the response because I know it.contradicts my imagination which which is the second function.of letter (footnote, this happened with your last email. I could not even open some of the photos Even though it looked also interlectual with all these fancy Latin based french words. But I really found it too romantic) . A way to follow up our own intricate trails of internal affairs and thought. I always fear to be too egocentric when I write letters because I don't ask too many&nbsp; further questions because they are pure speculation. But I'm curious and still like to interprete a world That's why I write personal stuff and not because of the style of of writing lengthy intellectual stuff. I still think 90percsnt of all Arty farty people are just pretentious and have no ability of self-reflection.<br>Lately, I was asking myself again this question because I saw the brusseleir again which I met with you and also your boyfriend (after all he seems a nice guy who asks the right questions. How creative his answers are I don't know). Funnily, they still remember me even when I don't remember their names anymore. But they still come politely and bisous me. And I'm still reserved and a bit distant because they connect me to a dead past.&nbsp;<br>So my Sherlock Holmes like observation goes like this. Premise : I saw a lot of your old people in some parties but not you. So either you moved away further than Belgium or you disconnected to some of them? In any case you moved to a plane which is out of my zone the ones I know For what reason case, I was expecting that you would go on a path of more resistance. When I met you were smart but far from&nbsp;</p>

According to <a href=""http://quantifiedself.com/2013/01/pew-internet-research-the-state-of-self-tracking/"" target=""_blank"">Pew Research Center</a>, 69 percent of adults track their health or the health of others, and 21 percent of those do so using some sort of hardware or software technology. Gartner forecasts worldwide shipments of <a href=""http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2913318"" target=""_blank"">65 million units</a> for “wearable electronic devices for fitness” in 2015. This might seem like a lot, but it’s actually a decrease from the earlier forecasts, which were 70.2 and 73 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. A 2014 survey of 24,000 individuals in 24 countries conducted <a href=""http://www.accenture.com/SiteCollectionDocuments/us-en/engaging-digital-consumer-new-connected-world.pdf"" target=""_blank"">by Accenture</a> found that 8 percent of people currently own a “fitness wearable,” while 12 percent plan to purchase one in the next year, 17 percent within three years, and 11 percent within five years.
Highlight:The core challenge facing the quantified self movement is that great data isn’t enough. As rational creatures, it’s in our nature as humans to want to collect, analyze, and interpret the information around us. The problem is, the devices in the market today, and the software that accompanies them, merely handle the collection portion of this puzzle. Far too much of the analytical heavy lifting is left to the end user. Owners of activity trackers, sleep monitors, heart-rate monitors, and the like are left saying, “So what? What do I do with this information?""
Highlight:Like many other technology obsessives and athletes, I’ve personally spent the last several years hoping that a quantified self company or product would emerge to help end users make sense of the data that we’re all collecting around ourselves. For example, it’s one thing to know you got a below-average quality of sleep last night. It’s entirely another thing to know what the implications of that fact are on weight gain, critical reasoning skills, and energy levels, both in the short- and long-term.

"Bright flashy c","https://www.diigo.com/item/note/5j1yj/88136a1f","girls,unknown","","","Highlight:<p>Bright flashy colors like jelly fishes jumping in my vision. It was her plastic runner jacket which was probably fabricated before she was born.&nbsp;Like so many she was all retro, wearing a style of fashion which is quite en vogue under twenty somethings.&nbsp;<br /><br />However, she got me, I was all her. The red color of her lips matched with parts of her jacket. Under it she wore a black dotted rose shirt combined with a a red skirt and stockings, the color I don't remember. Together, they were not quite fitting her silhouette. Her outfit was maybe half a number too big. Her supercharged gestures told me she was tired. Her laughing was a bit too loud, probably. I could not hear it, because there were maybe 5 meters between us on the dance floor which was shuttered by bass heavy EDM music. You could sense it, there was no deeper, critical discourse happening on the dance floor. Only drunk bodies going more or less nuts. Under normal circumstances the music and her style were too corny for my taste.<br /><br />But hey, I was also one of these moving bodies. Imprisoned by my own feelings. Smelling like pizza. Her blackish hair was framing her face like curtains of sweetness - lovability, sunset, hot breath and warm cheeks. I was caught by her gravity, my mind was drifting more and more into her direction. But my feet couldn't follow. I was stuck as so often. <br /><br />Move your ass and your mind will follow<br /><br />This time it was the opposite.<br /><br />The underground needs to be practiced and criticised while you go. We are comfortable in our uncertainty. To outsiders, we look like indifferent academics, practicing economics or something. Too old for being young, too young for being old.l</p>

I say met her even though I did not exchange a word with. She seemed peculiar because she was wearing a gentlemen's hat, but her silhouette, especially the one of her face was so nuanced subtle not quite feminine but also not really androgynous. She didn't make a big buzz about her at all. That was how her body language was. Unquestionably, she was Italian with all these exotic looks as it can get for another European country. Familiarity and strangeness come to my mind to describe my feelings for Italy. But maybe you can also say distance but with a smile on the person who establishes it.<br>A man's hat worn by girl/woman with red colored nails. But not in the way that catalogs and popular media would suggest. She transcended a deep tradition of people, culture, a complete way of being which I think I understand from my far vantage point. However, it's not my own tradition. I'm German or was until some time ago. And my skin still transpires it. Homecoming is a story which never ends. And for many Italian people it seems the inverse picture is true: they know where they come from but they deliberately chose to go away due to manifold economical reasons rooted in their country. Where these problems are exactly located, I don't know and I'm not here to judge. But what I know is that all my Italian friends just do as they are. They take their culture in their little leather bag fly away into the world - I know, I fall into cliches here but I still have the image of this beautiful hat wearing girl on my mind holding kinda bag with a pattern as playful that it becomes confusing and colors too many to be humble

Highlight:Yet being an e-learner means often being confronted with boring and poorly structured learning materials in the form of pdf files and PowerPoint, learning within learning management systems where interactions prove to be complicated, and where the entire e-learning process is, in most cases, still focused on the replication of facts and data instead of challenging the learner and enabling active interaction with the knowledge.
Highlight:By means of digital games and especially of digital educational games, learners should be able to apply factual knowledge, learn on demand, gain experiences in the virtual world that can later shape their behavioural patterns and directly influence their reflection, etc.
Highlight:Debriefing provides a link between simulation and the real world, draws a relationship between the game events and real-world events and connects game experience and learning.
Highlight:Adventure games use intrinsic motivation of the player to explore the game world. Intrinsically motivating games incorporate learning activities in their game world.

    can provide the basis for an exploratory learning system but that by itself 
    it is insufficient, needing to be supplemented by more directed guidance and 
    access mechanisms. In order to investigate this suggestion, they conducted 
    an experiment in which all subjects used the same material held in a hypertext 
    form, but with differing guidance and access facilities available. The baseline 
    group had a basic hypertext with no additional facilities, while other groups 
    had either a map or index or guided tours available, and a final group had 
    all three facilities (map, index, tours) available. Half of the subjects were 
    given a series of questions to answer while accessing the material (a directed 
    task) while the other half were instructed to make use of the material to 
    prepare for a subsequent multiple-choice test (an exploratory task).
Highlight:One of the earliest attempts to evaluate hypertext's 
    potential in a learning environment was that reported by Beeman <i>et al</i>.

Highlight:Usability now often subsumes qualities like <a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/fun"" title=""Fun"">fun</a>,  well being, collective efficacy, aesthetic tension, enhanced <a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/creativity"" title=""Creativity"">creativity</a>,  flow, support for human development, and others.
Highlight:Given the contemporary <a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/shape"" title=""Shape"">shape</a>  of HCI, it is important to remember that its origins are personal productivity interactions bound to the desktop, such as word processing and spreadsheets.
Highlight:It was surely a stark <a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/contrast"" title=""Contrast"">contrast</a>  to the immediately prior teletype metaphor of Unix, in which all interactions were accomplished by typing commands.
Highlight:Through the mid-1990s, HCI professionals and everyone else realized that search is a more fundamental paradigm than browsing for finding things in a user interface.
Highlight:One frontier today is ubiquitous computing: The pervasive incorporation of computing into human habitats — cars, home appliances, furniture, clothing, and so forth.
Highlight:For example, the GOMS (Goals, Operations, Methods, Selection rules) model, the earliest native theory in HCI, was a more comprehensive cognitive model

Highlight:People will like to take some actions when they feel certain emotions such as loneliness,hopelessness, disgust, pleasure, joy etc.
Highlight:The ""Hooked"" model is basically derived from general cognitive psychology about habit formation and researching recent companies that are social and big such as Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter, Instagram etc.
Highlight:<b><u>Triggers :</u></b> Triggers can be external or internal. <b>External triggers are the one where the trigger contains the information of what the next action should be such as ""click here"", ""share now"", ""like this'', ""pin this"" etc. Internal triggers are the one where the information for what to do next is contained in users memory via association.</b> People will like to take some actions when they feel certain emotions such as loneliness,hopelessness, disgust, pleasure, joy etc. In general negative emotions are much stronger than positive emotions and that's where the social media products come in to the picture. Social media products give us instant rewards and alleviate our boredom. They lift us up<b>. So product designers really have to think about what is that internal association is the users making with their products, instead of only thinking about design issues that are external to their website or app.</b> For example when it comes to Facebook the users are most likely to associate with it sharing, connection, getting likes, relatives, friends, FOMO(fear of missing out) etc--from their friends/relatives life. The <b>""Hooked""</b> model argue that the users are getting triggered by both their <b>""internal and external""</b> triggers and that's why they start taking actions that ultimately makes a habit of using that product.
Highlight:Internal triggers are the one where the information for what to do next is contained in users memory via association
Highlight:Triggers :

Highlight:Foursquare for Learning
Highlight:To the end user, the app hides out in the background most of the day, only popping up an alert when you are in an “errand location”.  When you are in an errand location, you see a smartphone alert, asking you if you’d like to complete an exercise.
Sticky notes:MEMO: push based notification to continue playing
Highlight:The first is location-based prompting, which in theory could push any notification or open app when a user enters a particular location (such as opening a news app when one gets on the subway in the morning). The second concept is designing learning modules that are contextualized to whatever it is that the user is doing at that particular moment. For example, while at a grocery store, a user may be presented with useful phrases to order food from the butcher and cheese counters

"Gee on What Video Games Have to Teach Us About Learning and Literacy  |  Chapter 2: Literacies' Purposes  |  Literacies  |  New Learning","http://newlearningonline.com/literacies/chapter-2/gee-on-what-video-games-have-to-teach-us-about-learning-and-literacy","no_tag","","","Highlight:First, in the modern world, language is not the only important communicational system. Today images, symbols, graphs, diagrams, artifacts, and many other visual symbols are particularly significant.
Highlight:Furthermore, very often today words and images of various sorts are juxtaposed and integrated in a variety of ways. In newspaper and magazines as well as in textbooks, images take up more and more of the space alongside words. In fact, in many modern high school and college textbooks in the sciences images not only take up more space, they now carry meanings that are independent of the words in the text. If you can’t read these images, you will not be able to recover their meanings from the words in the text as was more usual in the past.
Highlight:Video games are at the very beginning of their potential-”we ain’t seen nothin’ yet.” They will get deeper and richer. Eventually some form of conversation between real people and computer-created characters will occur alongside the conversations among people in their virtual and real identities that already take place in Internet gaming.
Highlight:But for now, video games are what they are, an immensely entertaining and attractive interactive technology built around identities. I have made but one claim for them here. They operate with — that is, they build into their designs and encourage — good principles of learning, principles that are better than those in many of our skill-and-drill, back-to-basics, test-them-until-they-drop schools.
Highlight:<strong>Identity Principle</strong>
			<p>
				Learning involves taking on and playing with identities in such a way that the learner has real choices (in developing the virtual identity) and ample opportunity to meditate on the relationship between new identities and old ones. There is a tripartite play of identities as learners relate, and reflect on, their multiple real-world identities, a virtual identity, and a projective identity.</p>

"10.1.1.644.8231 (1).pdf","https://www.diigo.com/item/pdf/5j1yj/0vir","no_tag","","","Highlight:New possibilities for teaching and learning provided by AR have been increasingly recognized by educational researchers.
Highlight:AR refers to “augmenting natural feedback to the operator with simulated cues”
Highlight:AR could enable (1) learning content in 3D perspectives, (2) ubiquitous, collaborative and situated learning, (3) learners’ senses of presence, immediacy, and immersion, (4) visualizing the invisible, and (5) bridging formal and informal learning. We discuss each aspect as follows.
Highlight:virtual 3D modeling package to observe and rotate a virtual 3D spinning earth to learn about earth and sun, and day and night. The traditional teaching session included reading of a print book, lecture about the solar system, and a demonstration using 3D physical objects (e.g., a tennis ball, a string, and a torch) to learn the same topics.
Highlight:Based on the most salient features of the approaches, we classify the instructional approaches into three major categories: approaches emphasizing engaging learners into “roles,” approaches emphasizing learners’ interactions with physical “locations,” and approaches emphasizing the design of learning “tasks.”
Highlight:An illustrative example of participatory simulations can be found in the Virus game in which students played viruses in the process of infectious disease transmission
Highlight:“locations”
Highlight:“tasks”
Highlight:AR games can be defined as “games played in the real world with the support of digital devices that create a fictional layer on top of the real world context” (Squire &amp; Jan, 2007, p. 6)
Highlight:Another task-based approach is problem-based learning. This approach is employed to promote self-directed learning, self-motivation, problem-solving skills, and knowledge-application skills (Liu et al., 2009).
Highlight:For example, Rosenbaum et al. (2007) showed that the sense of authenticity offered by an AR learning environment promoted learners’ understanding of dynamic models and complex causality.
Highlight:Additionally, AR systems provide solutions for learning difficulties that have been identified in previous research. For example, students usually encounter difficulties visualizing unobservable phenomena such as spinning of the earth (Kerawalla et al., 2006).

"242-4619-1-PB.pdf","https://www.diigo.com/item/pdf/5j1yj/e6xv","phd,paper,gamification","","","Highlight:The content of a video game is the story, information, and/or experience that is provided by playing a video game.  The value in video game content is similar to that of any work of art:  a shared experience that can be reflected upon.  Gamification takes valuable content and replaces it with rhetoric and advertising, or valueless content.
Highlight:McGonigal (2011) believes that games as an historical force can be traced to the ancient Greek Herodotus
Highlight:Gamification entrepreneurs will say they are using “techniques that game designers [have] used for years to motivate behavior - points, badges, levels, high score tables and virtual goods”
Highlight:Super Mario Bros. did not contain other so-called core mechanics such as badges or virtual goods.
Highlight:The lack of gamification mechanics used in Super Mario Bros. demonstrates that people will play video games in spite of these mechanics not because of them.
Highlight:The reason people found Super Mario Bros. engaging was because of content.
Highlight:While these stars are indeed an example of the use of badges within a video game, they are not a core mechanic.  Insteadbadges in this game are used to enhance the experience of the content of the game.
Highlight:Again, in the Tetris scenario the game mechanics are not necessary.  Score and level need not be present for Tetris to function as a game, although they do serve a purpose in that they allow players to gauge their ability.
Highlight:Many video games do use gamification mechanics in a variety of capacities.  The point is that video games do not need to use gamification mechanics to be successful, rather they should be treated as techniques that game designers can implement to amplify the style of content which games provide.
Highlight:In his article Who Killed Videogames? (A Ghost Story) Tim Rogers (2011) snidely likens modern video games to nineties little league baseball in which everyone
Highlight:social games such as Farmville also concludes that they are played to, “relax, escape from stress, and avoid responsibilities.” (Hou, 2011, p.13)
Highlight:Hou (2011) goes on to say, “challenge and competition have been documented as the most popular reasons for playing video games.
Highlight:Traditional video games seek to engage and enlighten players through valuable content.  In much the same way as a novel allows its readers to ponder the words written within, video games allow the player to think about the scenarios andinteract with the alternate reality presented in the game.
Sticky notes:storytelling
Highlight:Game mechanics are implemented, supplying an enslaving substitute for the demise of meaning.  Social media companies host the modern tavern, the sandbox, the walled garden, where its users play and produce value (p. 11).
Highlight:“Society seems to be headed to the digital medieval city where value is created for the corporations while its citizens are playing games and kept happy”  (p. 11).

Highlight:In Pokémon Go, users roam to parks, landmarks, and buildings in their communities to gather resources.
Highlight:Pokéstops, places where players can collect free items, are often placed at parks, historic sites, or monuments, drawing out local history, Torres said. By encouraging users to seek out these real-world landmarks in person, gamers are noticing their surroundings and absorbing real local history in ways that are getting educators excited, she explained.

Today’s smartphones carry a vast amount of all sorts of sensors that can track almost anything.

Highlight:“Storytelling is a process where students personalise what they learn and construct their own meaning and knowledge from the stories they hear and tell”
Highlight:A digital story can hence be seen as a merger between the old storytelling tradition and the use of new technology”
Highlight:“a short multimedia story that combines voice, image, and music”
Highlight:The key elements of behavioural patterns are motivation, answers, and the connection between them.
Highlight:Compared with behaviourism, which explores students’ behaviour, cognitive theories inquire into the processes driving the behaviour. It places greater emphasis on the environment to facilitate the learning process
Highlight:Bouman defines learning as the acquisition of knowledge or skills through experience, practice, or study, or by being taught.
Sticky notes:learning definition
Highlight:The learner’s active position is strongly emphasised as it is indispensable for the development of lifelong learning skills (Verenikina [<span class=""CitationRef""><a href=""#CR56"">2008</a></span>])
Highlight:The zone of proximal development (ZPD), developed by Vygotsky (Wells [<span class=""CitationRef""><a href=""#CR58"">1999</a></span>]), is defined as the distance between what a student can do with or without help

The contemporary filmmaker’s challenge is capturing the human relationship with text at a time when text-based communications are intricately woven into the social fabric of daily life but take place mostly on tiny, personal screens.
Highlight:“The truth is that software has an impact on what we say, and who we friend, and what we think of the world. Software is a designed object by humans which means that all software comes with some kind of intended effect.”

Highlight:Thus, UX is seen as <em class=""markup--em markup--p-em"">something </em>desirable, highlighting non-utilitarian aspects of interaction, while shifting the focus to user affect, sensation, and the meaning as well as value.
Sticky notes:non utilitarian
Highlight:Pragmatic quality focuses on the product´s utility and usability in relation to potential tasks, i.e. “making a phone call”, “setting up a website”, “watching TV”. Hassenzahl refers to it as “do-goals”.
Sticky notes:Do goals
Highlight:Thus,<strong class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong""> </strong>the concept of be-goals is moving beyond the instrumental facets, being motivated by the implication of general human needs, such as <em class=""markup--em markup--p-em"">“a need for novelty and change, personal growth, self-expression and/or relatedness”</em>(Hassenzahl, 2007).
Sticky notes:the concept of be-goals
Highlight:Human-Computer Interaction´s need for a theoretical framework is not self-obvious. It is apparent that in HCI, researchers and practitioners often describe the methods employed but only rarely frame their work within a theoretical framework (Kaptelinin &amp; Nardi, 2012).
Sticky notes:nullA theoretical framework -- 2016-11-14
A theoretical framework is lacking for UX -- 2016-11-14

Highlight:However, Hassenzahl (Hassenzahl, 2010) argues that the phenomenon of UX and its <em class=""markup--em markup--p-em"">“underlying principles [are not] very different from experience in general”.</em>
Sticky notes:important connection point to experience in general (experiential gaming model)
Highlight:Nevertheless, in order to be able to shape and create new experiences, the focus of the design approach needs to shift from the product to the design of the experiences itself.
Highlight:The theory distinguishes between: pragmatic and hedonic quality.

Highlight:The coming wave of automation, currently stalled because our social infrastructure cannot bear the consequences, will hugely diminish the amount of work needed – not just to subsist but to provide a decent life for all.
Highlight:Even now many people fail to grasp the true meaning of the word “austerity”. Austerity is not eight years of spending cuts, as in the UK, or even the social catastrophe inflicted on Greece. It means driving the wages, social wages and living standards in the west down for decades until they meet those of the middle class in China and India on the way up.

"Shirky: Ontology is Overrated -- Categories, Links, and Tags","http://www.shirky.com/writings/ontology_overrated.html","tagging","","","Highlight:The idea of
a perfect scheme is simply a Platonic ideal.  However, I want to argue
that even the ontological <i>ideal</i> is a mistake. Even using
theoretical perfection as a measure of practical success leads to
misapplication of resources.
Highlight:The categorization scheme is a response to physical constraints on storage, and to people's inability to keep the location of more than a few hundred things in their mind at once. Once you own more than a few hundred books, you have to organize them somehow. (My mother, who was a reference librarian, said she wanted to reshelve the entire University library by color, because students would come in and say ""I'm looking for a sociology book. It's green..."") But however you do it, the frailty of human memory and the physical fact of books make some sort of organizational scheme a requirement, and hierarchy is a good way to manage physical objects.
Highlight:t was the first really significant attempt to bring order to the Web. As the Web expanded, the Yahoo list grew into a hierarchy with categories.
Highlight:There's a top level, and subdirectories roll up under that.
Subdirectories contain files or further subdirectories and so on, all
the way down. Both librarians and computer scientists hit the same next
idea, which is ""You know, it wouldn't hurt to add a few secondary links
in here"" -- symbolic links, aliases, shortcuts, whatever you want to
call them.
Highlight:They said, ""Get out of
here with that crazy talk.  A URL can only appear in three places.
That's the Yahoo rule.""
Highlight:encode that in advance.""
Highlight:Browse versus search is a radical increase in the trust we put in link infrastructure, and in the degree of power derived from that link structure.  Browse says the people making the ontology, the people doing the categorization, have the responsibility to organize the world in advance.

But more in the way that I forgot about you, unfortunately)</div><div>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>Dear&nbsp;***** (I stumble upon the keys and realize that it's not the name I write the most fluently),<div><br></div><div>actually, I wanted to write you some positive lines already this weekend, but it did not work out. All I had was some kind of bunch of phrases, quotes and ideas I collected over the time. They were not really presentable and probably hard to grasp for somebody who sits on the other end of the cable crossing a short physical but a long mental distance. So, instead I wrote a cheesy pop song (no worries, not for you) which turned out to be only collage of George Harrison and&nbsp;</div><div>The Kinks references.&nbsp;<br></div><div><br></div><div>So it goes like this:</div><div>Imagine, a journey starting in a dirty, grungy bar where you meet a transvestite called ""Lola"" who takes you over the ""Waterloo Sunset"" to your private and eternal paradise ""Shangri-La"". Only to realize that the eternity which is sold on the streets is a big, big lie. Upset but somehow still cheerful you walk away with George Harrison in your ears:&nbsp;</div><blockquote></blockquote><i><br></i><blockquote></blockquote><i>Sunset doesn't last all evening</i><br><blockquote></blockquote><i>A mind can blow those clouds away</i><br><blockquote></blockquote><i>After all this, my love is up and must be leaving</i><br><i>It's not always going to be this grey<br></i><div><i><br></i></div><div>The point is that I wrote this kinda pop song for a girl which happens to combine all colors of the universe in her appearance but in a purified form (especially when she's drunk). Even though she is not far from failure, not at all. The ignorance she exposes with her face which probably only overlays some kind of inner squalor is dangerous. It gives me a glimpse of what could happen with me when I really decide to embark on this boat called love. Nothing good!</div><div>But the truth is I'm already on my way to cross the deep blue ocean and ready to sink 1000 m deep.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>So, why do I write you this stuff? To put it frankly, for the sake of compliance. Who helps you out of any shit and stays always polite with a slight distance not to be in danger to mix privacy and work? It is the lawyer. She or he is always professional, does his/her job, is loyal, the relation to his/her client is always clear defined. No ambiguity is allowed....</div><div><br></div><div>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div><br></div>(And here the story ends. Not sure what I really intended with this lawyer metaphor. Maybe, I was in the lofty dream to have a normal friendship with you. Even though I must admit that I cannot really smell too many native people from Brussels. Not that I want to be a racist. But you all know each other. It's like a super dense spider net. I was always skeptical about groups consisting of more than five people. To my own frustration I'm still on that lonesome track. You remember when you came over there was this girl with charlo. Actually, I slept with her. That's why I was so confused...)

Highlight:Nevertheless, Carr insists that the negative side effects of the Internet outweigh its efficiencies. Consider, for instance, the search engine, which Carr believes has fragmented our knowledge. “We don’t see the forest when we search the Web,” he writes. “We don’t even see the trees. We see twigs and leaves.”
Highlight:e’s horrified by the way computers are destroying our powers of concentration.
Highlight:electronic screen is an “ecosystem of interruption technologies,”
Highlight:And so we lurch from site to site, if only because we constantly crave the fleeting pleasure of new information. But this isn’t really the fault of the Internet. The online world has merely exposed the feebleness of human attention, which is so weak that even the most minor temptations are all but impossible to resist.

Highlight:he belief that the user is in the driver's seat of socio-technical innovation.
Highlight:The traditional one-way broadcasting media landscape turns into a converged media ecosystem
Highlight:prosumers
Highlight:the claims made on agency and societal impact are often overrated
Highlight:commercial internet media are fully domesticated
Highlight:we find how current transitions in the media and technology landscape go together with a shift from mass media and personal media to media for 'mass selfcommunication'.
Highlight:On the other hand 'self-communication' because the message production is typically self-generated, the potential receiver(s) definition is self-directed and the message or content retrieval is selfselected.
Highlight:mpowerment is defined as ""enabling people to control their own lives and to take advantage of opportunities"" (van der MAESEN &amp; WALKER, 2002: 6) or in other words ""a process, a mechanism by which people, organisations, and communities gain mastery over their affairs""
Highlight:""the interaction between people and their environment, based on mutual respect and critical reflection, by which individuals as well as controlling institutions change in such a way that individuals get a bigger influence on people and institutions that prevent them from acquiring an equal position in society""
Sticky notes:empowerment
Highlight:Capabilities in this sense are the underpinning of the freedom of people to construct meaningful lives.
Highlight:We thus define user empowerment in relation to social media as the capability for interpreting and acting upon the social world that is intensively mediated by mass self-communication.
Highlight:inclusion, literacy and privacy
Highlight:First, there is no automatic link between social media and user empowerment as not all users are able, willing or even permitted to get involved and participate by means of or through digital media.
Highlight:issues of access, digital inclusion, infrastructure and regulation
Highlight:issue of digital media literacy
Highlight:empowering people in the context of mass self-communication means enhancing the capabilities of genuinely understanding and acting upon the social world by social media, on the levels of inclusion, digital literacy and privacy.
Highlight:the instruments and means for mass selfcommunication by users through social media are proliferating, reinforcing the idea of users effectively becoming empowered.
Highlight:The latter means that the social world intensively mediated by mass selfcommunication creates (new) circumstances of vulnerability where people do not always have the necessary capabilities to optimally interpret and act upon other people and institutions for acquiring an equal position in society.
Sticky notes:disempowerment
Highlight:There is for example a substantial chance that online user practices via social media are more persistent in time, have a broader geographical reach and are picked up by unwanted receivers
Sticky notes:positive consequences of more risks in social media communication (broadcast - who do you really reach?)
Highlight:disempowerment refers to people actually losing power and capabilities to gain control over their lives mediated by social media. We now further elaborate on the notion of vulnerability.
Highlight:external side of vulnerability related to 'exposure' (see also BALL, 2009: 647) and an internal side related to 'coping capacities'
Sticky notes:two main parts
Highlight:They have defined vulnerability as a multi-layered and multi-dimensional social space defined by the political, economic, and institutional capabilities of people in specific places and times
Highlight:The external perspective refers mainly to the structural dimensions of vulnerability exposure, while the internal dimension of vulnerability focuses on coping and action to overcome or at least mitigate negative effects (BOHLE, 2001).
Highlight:confronting the structural element of 'affordances' with the action-oriented element of 'practices'
Highlight:'affordances', defined as the combination of perceived and actual properties of the (social media) technology, primarily those fundamental properties that determine just how that technology could possibly be used
Highlight:We use the structure of external and internal sides of vulnerability and the related affordances and practices of social media, for our further analysis
Highlight:define privacy as ""the right to be left alone""
Highlight:As mentioned before 'vulnerability' has an external side of 'exposure' and an internal side of 'coping'. Each side has specific characteristics when coupled with mass self-communication.
Highlight:Part of the typical affordances of social media is that the thresholds for more and other types of personal data becoming publicly diffused, are lowered
Highlight:mass self-communication increases exposure by opening up private domains which in the past were much more difficult to access.
Highlight:But, other information is captured apart from explicit communication actions, it is gathered implicitly. Common examples are mouse clicks, browsing behaviour, operating system and browser information (PIERSON &amp; HEYMAN, 2011).
Sticky notes:surveiliance
Highlight:The most visible type of disclosure is happening on an explicit way in the case of 'privacy as subject'.
Highlight:he explicit exposure is done by people themselves by making details of their private life openly available via all kinds of social media applications, especially SNS
Highlight:Yet these revelations increase the vulnerability to the extent that the disclosure of personal data and the interactions that follow, do not happen at the users' discretion.
Highlight:Yet at the same time these affordances can help people in new ways of identity construction or ""writing oneself into being""
Highlight:'privacy as object'
Sticky notes:information tracing via cookies
Highlight:'dataveillance'
Highlight:'social sorting'
Highlight:The two perspectives of privacy as subject and privacy as object show how exposure as the external side of vulnerability can take shape.
Highlight:The internal side of vulnerability refers to the ways that consumers are able (or not) to harness themselves against vulnerability in their everyday social media practices.
Highlight:ontrol and consumer knowledge
Highlight:control in relation to consumer privacy:
Highlight:(a) presence of other people in the environment during a market transaction or consumption behavior
Highlight:(b) dissemination of information related to or provided during such transactions or behaviors to those who were not present.""
Highlight:This type of consumer control is also central in the debate concerning opt-in (consumers giving explicit permission to use personal data for commercial purposes) and opt-out (the right to oppose the use or re-use of personal data)
Highlight:consumer knowledge
Highlight:This suggests that the vulnerability of the least skilled population is magnified by how companies choose to set or adjust default privacy settings.""
Highlight:mass self-communication
Highlight:Consumers are possibly disempowered by new and extended ways of exposure, linked to the affordances of social media from a 'privacy as subject' perspective
Highlight:strengthen the digital (consumer) literacy on the level of understanding privacy and personal data

Sticky notes:web 2.0
Highlight:Users are generally referred to as active internet contributors
Highlight:prosumer
Highlight:Google’s acquisition was not about bringing innovative technology into the home, as its own GoogleVideo was already running on superior software; it was about bringing in communities of users.
Highlight:User agency is cast by cultural theorists as participatory engagement, in contrast to the passive recipients of earlier stages of media culture.
Highlight:With the emergence of Web 2.0 applications, cultural theorist Henry Jenkins (2006) sees a definite paradigm shift in the way media content is produced and circulated: ‘Audiences, empowered by these new technologies, occupying a space at the intersection between old and new media, are demanding the right to participate within the culture’
Highlight:hen ‘old media’still reigned, media recipients had little direct power to shape media content and faced enormous barriers to enter the marketplace, whereas ‘the new digital environment expands the scope and reach of consumer activities’
Highlight:grassroots movements
Highlight:monitorial citizens’
Highlight:There are several assumptions implied in the notion of participatory culture that I want to relativize in this section.
Sticky notes:it's not all that participatory!
Highlight:participation refers to citizens and community activists as well as to people who deploy their skills and talents towards a common cause.
Highlight:recipients of cultural content – whether fiction, music, film or television – have always engaged in activities, such as bands playing cover versions of songs or fan clubs stimulating the recreation of content.
Highlight:What is different in the digital era is that users have better access to networked media, enabling them to ‘talk back’ in the same multimodal language that frames cultural products formerly made exclusively in studios.
Highlight:However, it’s a great leap to presume that the availability of digital networked technologies turns everyone into active participants.
Highlight:As a Guardian technology reporter observes, an emerging rule of thumb suggests that ‘if you get a group of 100 people online then one will create content, 10 will “interact” with it (commenting or offering improvements) and the other 89 will just view it
Highlight:3 percent are ‘active creators’ – people actually producing and uploading content such as webblogs, videos or photos. Just under 19 percent qualify as ‘critics’, which means they provide ratings or evaluations. Furthermore, 15 percent of all users are ‘collectors’, a term referring to those who save URLs on a social bookmarking service which can be shared with other users; another 19 percent count as ‘joiners’ – people who join social networking sites such as MySpace or Facebook,
Highlight:The majority of users consist of ‘passive spectators’ (33%) and ‘inactives’ (52%);
Highlight:Media use was and still is strongly defined by evolving group identities, as individual viewers tie in their personal taste and lifestyles with shared ‘mediated’experiences.
Highlight:Scholars theorizing the current trend of participatory culture emphasize users’ strong preference to share knowledge and culture in communities.
Highlight:the term ‘community’relates to groups with a communal preference in music, movies or books (a so-called ‘taste community’);
Highlight:brand communities
Sticky notes:we are brand not taste communities
Highlight:A more profound problem with ascribing participatory involvement and community engagement to users per se, is its neglect of the substantial role a site’s interface plays in manoeuvring individual users and communities.
Highlight:YouTube users are steered towards a particular video by means of coded mechanisms which heavily rely on promotion and ranking tactics, such as the measuring of downloads and the promotion of popular favourites. The site’s users indeed serve as providers and arbiters of content – both unwittingly by means of download counts and consciously by rating and commenting on videos – but rankings and ratings are processed with the help of algorithms, the technical details of which remain undisclosed
Highlight:In the emergent participatory culture, ‘participation’is thus an ambiguous concept
Highlight:When looking at user-generated content, we also need to take account of a site’s coded abilities to steer and direct users.
Highlight:business interest has apparently shifted away from consuming activities and gravitated towards producing activities, giving users more power over content because they add business value.
Highlight:This new status of the people-formerly-known-as-consumers prompts further critical assessment of user agency.
Highlight:In these markets, consumers have been targeted as masses, groups and individuals, and they have exerted power over cultural content via their power as consumers (e.g. buying or boycotting products, giving input to consumer panels, etc.)
Sticky notes:old markets (non digital)
Highlight:As argued in the previous section, only a small percentage of users actually create content whereas the large majority consists of spectators or passive viewers; yet all categories of users actually qualify as potential consumers.
Highlight:The social demographics of UGC platform visitors bespeak an average user who is highly educated, well connected and well paid, with an average household income of almost twice the median income of American families (Li, 2007: 6).
Sticky notes:what?
Highlight:content providers and data providers
Highlight:Metadatacanbemined for various purposes, from targeted advertising to interface optimization, but the bottom line is that users have no power over data distribution.
Highlight:Metadata are not merely a by-product of user-generated content:the yareaprimeresourceforprof ilingrealpeoplewithrealinterests.
Highlight:googlization’
Highlight:Notwithstandingneologismstoutingtheuserasa‘produser’and‘co-creator’, the user’s role as a data provider is infinitely more important than his role as a content provide
Highlight:On the one hand users assert their creative agency by demanding a greater role in content production; on the other hand they lose their grip on their agency as consumers as a result of technological algorithms tracking their behaviour and refining their profile
Highlight:User agency thus comprises content production, consuming behaviour and data generation; any theory highlighting only the first of these functions effectively downplays the tremendous influence of new media companies in directing users’agency.
Sticky notes:important!
Highlight:users contribute creative efforts ‘outside of professional routines and practices’. Terms such as ‘hobbyists’, ‘amateurs’, ‘unpaid labourers’ and ‘volunteers’ often applied to internet contributors, contrast with the words ‘professionals’, ‘stars’, ‘paid experts’and ‘employees’commonly attributed to people producing traditional television content.
Highlight:resulting in new mixed models of labour.
Highlight:What characterizes the type of effort users put into creating and rating online content if this is not regularly paid labour?
Highlight:The changesYouTube made in its policies towards users are typical of the current trend towards integrating amateur efforts into a capital- and technology-intensive media system.
Highlight:Since the beginning of the web, thousands of volunteers, hobbyists and idealists have enabled the development of what some observers have described as a ‘gift economy for information exchange’ (Barbrook, 2002).
Highlight:The worldwide web, after all, was envisioned as a new frontier space where grassroots initiatives, communal spirit and ‘free’ amateur culture had a chance to blossom.
Highlight:Labour critics and neo-Marxist scholars noticed early on how the glamorization of the digital domain was a convenient pretense for the mobilization of ‘immaterial labour’ – befitting the familiar logic of capitalist exploitation (Hardt and Negri, 2000; Terranova, 2000)
Highlight:users can be segmented according to one of three primary
Highlight:motivations: entertainment, career and family.
Highlight:inkering with media technologies has been the department of hobbyists since the time of radio hams, and digital labour has acquired the image of being creative play
Highlight:Labourv olunteeredtoUGCsitesisthusnot conceived of as work, but as fun or play.
Highlight:the workforce of designers, software developers and hardware engineers are attracted to places with an ‘anti-corporate culture’ where young people are ready to work unusual hours for sometimes very little money;
Highlight:geek culture
Highlight:The contention that UGC platforms stimulate a democratic culture dominated by creative amateurs and providing free culture (Lessig, 2004) has been countered by vehement criticism.
Highlight:as the example of YouTube shows, the sliding scales of voluntarism and professionalism result in a variety of labour relationships, as well as in a recalibrated system of financial rewards, risks and benefits in an emerging ‘options’market. Instead of bringing down the reigning professional leagues, UGC actually boosts the power of media moguls, enhancing their system of star ratings and upward mobility.
Highlight:paid tribute to the millions of anonymous, productive contributors to the web
Highlight:meanwhile entered the era of commercialized user-generated content, where user activity is heavily mediated by high-tech algorithms and datamining firms.

Highlight:separating innovation from invention
Highlight:Invention has generally been understood as it was described in the popular accounts, as a process of creative insight and heroic efforts in problem solving.
Highlight:nnovation,  in  contrast,  has  been  defined  as  a  process  that  refines  inventions and translates them into usable products.
Highlight:linear model of innovation
Highlight:nnovations  are  first  invented  and  then  developed,  packaged,  marketed,  and, finally, taken into use.
Highlight:In practice, innovations emerge in a complex iterative process where communication,  learning,  and  social  interaction  play  important  roles.
Highlight:communication  and  flow  of knowledge  is  critical  in  the  innovation  process.
Highlight:users  often  play  an  important  role  in  the process of innovation by modifying and improving products
Sticky notes:examples ???
Highlight:internalization of customer and market knowledge is critical for successful product creation.

Sticky notes:pipeline vs circle
Highlight:In demand articulation, potential user needs are integrated into a product concept, and the emerging product concept, in turn, is decomposed into development agendas for its individual component technologies.
Sticky notes:user centered development
Highlight:The conventional view assumed that the product of the invention process has well-defined characteristics
Highlight:the exact details of the process of invention were often considered to be irrelevant.
Sticky notes:in conventional view
Highlight:invention was put in its own opaque box, veiled under impenetrable layers of creativity and insight.
Sticky notes:work of genius, cannot be decomposed! and innovation is still there to some extent. There are no real good examples where the user is actually taking over the design. Except, Modding, open source (grass rooted). An Open Consumer product does not exist. A company often takes ownership and develops a commercial product.
Highlight:New technologies do not come into the world ready-made. Instead, they are actively interpreted and appropriated by  existing  actors,  in  the  context  of  their  existing  practices.  A  single  technological artefact  can  have  multiple  uses,  and  new  uses  may  be  invented  for  old  artefacts. Often a product is used in unanticipated ways, and perhaps no one uses it the way its designers expected it to be used.
Sticky notes:how a product is perceived and used in reality!
Highlight:The  traditional  view assumed  that  invention  happens  when  a  new  concrete  artefact  or  mental  insight is  created.
Highlight:Therefore we can say that invention occurs only when social practice changes.
Sticky notes:innovation is innovation only if it has social impact
Highlight:ser-centered  model  is  useful and  provides  new  insights  on  the  process  of  innovation
Highlight:interpretative flexibility’
Highlight:A  given  technological  artefact  can  play  several  different roles in different social practices.
Highlight:the artefact  in  question  has  many,  and  possibly  incompatible,  articulations
Highlight:These ‘meaningful products’ may develop independently of each other, and one technological artefact can embed several meaningful products simultaneously.
Highlight:defining innovation as something that generates and facilitates change in social practice,  we  put  the  user  in  a  central  place  in  the  process  of  innovation.
Highlight:promoters of a technology do not necessarily  know  or  decide  its  final  uses;  that  they  seek  problems  or  needs  for  which  their technology  is  the  answer,  but  that  consumers  themselves  develop  new  uses  and  ultimately decide  which  will  predominate.
Highlight:The  story  suggests  that  in  promoting  a  technology,  vendors are constrained not only by its technical and economic attributes but also by an interpretation of its uses that is shaped by its and their histories, a cultural constraint that can persist over many years.
Highlight:Innovation,  therefore,  is  not  generated  only  by  scientists  or  engineers,  and  often they are not critical sources of innovation.
Highlight:The traditional model of a heroic inventor is therefore losing some of its obviousness and descriptive value.
Highlight:a  typical invention is a well-defined artefact with well-defined characteristics. Consequently, new uses are new ways of using this given artefact.
Sticky notes:well defined product, usages may differ
Highlight:T echnological objects are not something that we can discover from  nature:  they  exist  as  material  artefacts  that  embed  uses. Technological  artefacts are artefacts full of meaning. If this meaning is taken away, we are not left with the ‘objective’ object without subjective interpretations: instead, we are left with a pile of undifferentiated matter.
Highlight:We rarely meet technological objects without  some  interpretation  of  their  meaning.  Even  when  we  have  no  clue  what  the object  is  supposed  to  do,  we  still  normally  assume  that  someone  knows
Highlight:Most current technologies come ‘packaged’ with standard ways of using the technology, and in everyday conversation we take these standard uses for granted.
Highlight:xceptional  uses,  however,  imply that there is a normal way of using the phone, and a corresponding standard interpretation of the meaning of the thing.
Highlight:The reasons are complex and fundamentally social
Highlight:Technology  enters  our  life  as  a  way  to  conduct  meaningful  social  practice.
Highlight:Therefore technology does not exist in a ‘pure objective form’ outside the context of social practice.
Highlight:Technology always exists as technology-in-use, and it is, in general, impossible  to  find  a  stable  core  use  which  would  well  define  the  nature  of  a  technological artefact. 
Highlight:There is no hard core of technology that would provide a fixed foundation for different variations of use; instead, there are multiple ways a given technology can be appropriated by different actors, and different ways these actors can integrate technological products in their everyday life.
Highlight:Social practice therefore grounds collective meaning.
Highlight:The traditional view on innovation was based on the idea that innovation is well represented  by  the  material  object  that  embeds  the  invention
Sticky notes:limited in context of use
Highlight:The usercentric view on innovation leads to a very different prototypical innovation. Instead of material it focuses on mental. In the user-centric view, a prototypical innovation is more like a word or a concept. A word acquires its meaning through the ways it is used in communication. The same word can be used in many ways and it can play different roles in different types of conversations.
Sticky notes:much like a user experience
Highlight:Innovation  is,  therefore,  as  much  about  creating  new  meanings  as  it  is  about creating  novel  material  artefacts.
Highlight:Whereas the traditional view saw  technological  innovation  as  something  that  generated  functional  objects,  the user-centric  view  sees  these ‘objects’  as  carriers  of  social  practice  and  as  artefacts that embed theories of meaningful use.
Sticky notes:social practice ?= user experience on a higher scale
Highlight:Even though a designer of a new product may have a theory of use, there is no guarantee that this theory works in practice.
Sticky notes:I doubt that the functionality is open for discussion as such as implied here
Highlight:One relevant actor in all this, of course, is the producer of a technological product
Highlight:the  practices  of  the  manufacturer  are important when we try to understand the emergence of an innovation, they do not determine the evolution of the innovation
Highlight:The ‘essence’ of a specific technological artefact cannot be found only by asking what its manufacturer believes the artefact to be.
Highlight:One way to view the role of manufacturer is to see it as one user of a technological product  among  others.
Highlight:The economic view of the world is a very special view. Indeed, it is a special case of the utilitarian view that underlies also the modern concept of technology.
Highlight:In a consistent utilitarian world, there are no ends but only means.
Highlight:In Kant’ s philosophy, the world is an instrument for our interests and needs but we have to regard human beings as special cases, and treat them as ends in themselves, never only as means for other ends.
Highlight:The  infinite  chain  of  means–ends  relations  was  connected by profit, which became the end of all means.
Highlight:For economic actors, the economic system is a perpetuum mobile, where quality can only appear in terms of quantity
Highlight:economic growth is the mother of all ends
Highlight:the structure of economic explanations is that the meaning  of  products  and  production  can  be  understood  without  reference  to  the social  and  material  reality.
Highlight:The meaning of economic life is profit.
Highlight:This world has been constituted by culture in two ways. Culture is the ‘lens’ through which all phenomena are seen.
Highlight:this  meaning  can  be  characterized  in  terms  of  two  concepts: cultural categories and cultural principles.
Highlight:Cultural categories represent the basic  distinctions  with  which  a  culture  divides  up  the  phenomenal  world
Highlight:Cultural  principles,  in turn,  provide  the  principles  that  allow  us  to  evaluate,  rank,  construe,  distinguish, and interrelate phenomena in the world
Highlight:It  is  thus  that  each  culture  establishes  its  own  special  vision  of  the  world  and  thus  that  it renders  the  understandings  and  rules  appropriate  to  one  cultural  context  preposterously inappropriate in the next
Highlight:Cultural categories cannot be seen as such in the world. Instead, they remain invisible,  at  the  same  time  providing  a  structure  of  distinctions  that  is  continuously reproduced in social life
Highlight:Cultural categories can be embedded in artefacts through the systems of advertising and fashion. Advertising brings a consumer good and a representation of the culturally constituted world together, so that the known properties of the world can become  resident  in  the  unknown  properties  of  the  consumer  good
Highlight:hippies  and  punks  redefined  the  categories  of  age and  status,
Highlight:hese groups became ‘meaning suppliers’ for the mainstream culture.
Sticky notes:sub cultures
Highlight:By  consuming  the  products,  the  meaning  can  transfer  to  the  consumer. McCracken  proposed  that  there  are  four  ways  this  transfer  can  occur.
Highlight:First,  there exist  various  possession  rituals.  Consumers  may  clean,  discuss,  compare,  reflect, show off, and, for example, photograph their new possessions

"UNM21_Peine&Herrmann_in_TFSC.pdf","https://www.diigo.com/item/pdf/5j1yj/46wg","user,innovation,new-media","","","Highlight:the innovation literature that have presented innovation as a distributed process that combines knowledge of designers and users:
Highlight:domestication
Highlight:Our vantage point is that policy makers and innovators alike have become increasingly interested in particular challenges on the demand side of innovation [5]. Sustainable or eco-innovation is a recent example [6], where technological change is seen as a potential solution to the societal challenge of facilitating transitions towards more sustainable forms of energy production and use.
Highlight:diachronic dimension
Highlight:domestication research has delved deeply into the issues at stake when new technical objects are embedded in the local practices of users
Highlight:the Neo-Schumpeterian evolutionary tradition of economics has therefore revolved around the idea that innovation is a process that responds to supply and demand side factors simultaneously
Highlight:First, user needs should be treated as something different than demand in its strict economic sense, mostly because user needs refer to a quality and demand refers to a quantity
Highlight:Rosenberg further distinguished between disembodied learning, where experience during use leads to an improved understanding of how a product can be operated, and embodied learning, where learning by using leads to actual design modifications—either because users modify a product directly or propose a modification to a manufacturer
Sticky notes:open source, modding, hacking
Highlight:Secondly, the early studies have brought to the fore that innovation is a co-evolutionary process in which knowledge about the use of a technology accumulates together with knowledge about its desig
Highlight:Indeed, at the outset of an innovation neither product characteristics are known nor user needs are “out there” to be elicited. Rather, users have to develop their needs and the forms of meeting these needs through experience with evolving product characteristics
Highlight:As use knowledge, we define knowledge about the context and character of use and about the characteristics of users. Use knowledge, therefore, includes both knowledge about users and their needs and preferences, as well as knowledge about the functionality, usability and utility of a product.
Highlight:Eric von Hippel and scholars working in his tradition have shown that users are not just important in innovation but frequently are the actual source of innovation:
Highlight:users often invent, prototype and field-test significant increments in functional utility themselves
Highlight:while a user profits directly from the enhanced functionality of an innovation
Highlight:Quite often the source of innovation is the user, be it an individual or an organization. User innovations are tailored directly to the particular needs of the innovator who thus profits from increased functionality, rather than from a higher commercial value.
Sticky notes:the user wants increased quality, the producer wants quality

making a product better for her/his own needs. tuning a car, hacking, forking
Highlight:After all, user innovations embody intimate knowledge of the use environment and thus also an elevated functional value.
Highlight:First, a user develops an innovation to obtain its direct use value and, subsequently, refines this innovation by sharing the necessary information with other users
Highlight:Secondly, some users might be willing to purchase the innovation from one of the original innovators because they are not willing or able to spend the necessary time and effort to reproduce an innovation.
Highlight:Thirdly, established manufacturers eventually join the process when they perceive a version of the user innovation to be attractive enough for a larger number of customers, i.e., when they see a commercial value in the user innovation.
Highlight:Users often share information so that other users can replicate the original innovation, and large manufacturers pick up commercially attractive versions of a user innovation and produce it for a broader set of customers. Often the spread and evolution of a user innovation involve both mechanisms, although either can also function separately
Sticky notes:exchange of knowledge
Highlight:every innovation involves combining use and design knowledge. These types of knowledge are distributed asymmetrically among manufacturers and users and are
Highlight:“sticky”, i.e. they cannot be transferred between users and manufacturers at a reasonable cost
Highlight:In the user innovation model, the source of use knowledge is straightforward—it is simply the user.
Sticky notes:the role of knowledge in innovation
Highlight:When, under which circumstances and in what form do local modifications or inventions of users turn into widely diffused changes of a technology?
Sticky notes:key question of the article (!!!)
Highlight:the generation of use value by users is not a phenomenon of great significance. But if users become involved with the generation of exchange value, i.e., value that can be traded beyond the context from which it originally arose, this marks an important shift in the role distribution between producers and users.
Highlight:ll innovations incorporate knowledge about use
Highlight:He explored the metaphor of a machine as text, which, as he argues, allows for the distinction between the writing (construction) of a machine and its subsequent reading (use).
Highlight:A machine thus mediates between its writers and readers. The essential point Woolgar derives from this analogy is that a machine, by the way it is designed, assumes some degree of authority about its future users.
Highlight:the company not only constructed a user, but also dedicated a considerable amount of effort to design the machine to configure real users accordingl
Highlight:Designers' preconceptions about users and use, Woolgar concludes, become incorporated in technical objects and thus “the evolving machine effectively attempts to configure the user” [17: 61]
Sticky notes:key passage for this paragraph
Highlight:designers inscribe in to a technical object a vision of future users and use.
Highlight:“Thus, like a film script, technical objects define a framework of action together with the actors and the space in which they are supposed to act”
Sticky notes:in other words designer design for experiences!
Highlight:technical objects become real only through the actual users, uses, and networks they describe.
Highlight:it is the adjustment between projected and real users that determines the fate of a technical object.
Highlight:designers construct use knowledge before real use takes place.
Highlight:esigners frequently project themselves as future users, implicitly refer to their own preferences and skills as source of use knowledge, or infer such knowledge from stories circulating within their professional networks
Highlight:Domesticating
Highlight:they create a relevance structure for technical objects
Highlight:domestication research has concentrated on the meaning and relevance of things rather than their functionality as a centerpiece of innovation
Highlight:To this end, it has looked at users in their everyday lives to argue that, in the sphere of users, artifacts undergo an intricate process through which their relevance is spelled out, and different forms of use are defined and put into practice
Highlight:At the core of domestication research is a framework proposed by Silverstone et al. [18] that distinguishes between four elements: appropriation, objectification, incorporation, and conversion.
Highlight:ppropriation takes place at the point of purchase, when an individual acquires a commodity. Through appropriation, commodities turn into objects and achieve authenticity and significance as they move from the public into the domestic. Through appropriation, an artifact is introduced into the spatial and temporal patterns of the moral economy of the househol
Highlight:Objectification, then, describes the disposition and display of the artifact, through which it becomes part of, contributes to and signifies the esthetic culture of a domestic sphere. Artifacts are not objectified in isolation, but they are linked to and molded according to an “already constructed [...] and meaningful spatial environment”
Highlight:As a complement to this, incorporation focuses on the way artifacts are used, and describes how they are incorporated into the routines of daily life.
Highlight:It is conversion that safeguards the significance of domestication work in the more immediate environment of the neighborhood, work or peer group, but also as signals “for producers and their allies in the market”
Highlight:Domestic environments have thus increasingly been defined in a broad sense including home and work environments as locally bounded social contexts.
Sticky notes:nuclear families [166], 
single parents [167], 
low-income home owners [168] 
older adults [169]. 
professional contexts such as small and medium sized enterprises
Highlight:First, domestication can be interpreted as a specific form of user innovation—individuals (as members of a domestic sphere) actively work towards redefining the nature of an artifact, and traces of these redefinitions accumulate and shape the public meaning of that artifact. Redefinition, however, is defined purely in terms of the practical and symbolic work of users, rather than in terms of design changes. Initially, therefore, domestication describes a local and disembodied form of learning by using. It does not stop here, however. Through conversion the local work of users contributes to the generalization and stabilization of a technology's identity in the public sphere as well.
Sticky notes:that's what is domestification about (!)
Highlight:In principle, therefore, domestication describes a collective and cumulative learning process through which disembodied knowledge is diffused.
Highlight:The approach, however, has tended to explore in detail the objectification and incorporation of artifacts in particular settings more than it has specified mechanisms of conversion across such settings.
Sticky notes:shortcomings in conversion (diffusion) to peer groups research
Highlight:Consequently, it has difficulties to explain how the results of disembodied learning during domestication become embodied in design changes.
Sticky notes:transition among domestification and user innovation
Highlight:In other words, domestication research has not, so far, delivered an understanding of the “design/domestication interface”
Highlight:User innovations have been studied from an economic and management perspective, where value, knowledge sharing and incentives are central concepts.
Highlight:inally, domestication research, rooted in anthropological studies of consumption, has tended to focus on the meaning created around technological objects, rather than embodied technological change
Highlight:use knowledge. They revolve around the idea that technological change entails new ideas about prospective users, contexts of use, and forms of use to which a technology should be put.
Highlight:he user innovation literature is largely in line with classical contributions: users, by using a particular technology, accumulate experience of use and thus obtain a more specific idea of the functions they need.
Highlight:The domestication literature has added to this an understanding that disembodied learning includes the production of a shared sense of meaning, which, in turn, is entangled deeply with the definition of what function is and could be.
Highlight:learning about use: Disembodied learning cuts across various locales of the innovation process including the R&amp;D labs of manufacturing companies, the sites of intermediaries, and the households of consumers.
Sticky notes:disembodied learning!
Highlight:Design knowledge is a natural counterpart of use knowledge;
Highlight:design knowledge embodies knowledge about users and use.
Highlight:technological designs are not innocent, but that they, by way of incorporating certain selections of use knowledge, deploy certain ideas about users and use.
Highlight:situated learning
Highlight:embedding use with design knowledge (i.e. embodied learning
Highlight:in user innovations, users draw on their often tacit experience created through learning by using to modify a technology.
Highlight:I-methodology
Sticky notes:it's me the user! (developer's perspective)
Highlight:The upper-right box of Fig. 1 represents the case of producer innovations that draw on some form of explicit consideration of users and use.
Highlight:crossing the boundary between disembodied and embodied learning is a process that not only involves the creation of use knowledge, but also the often implicit selection and translation of use knowledge that becomes part of design decisions.
Highlight:Cumulative learning
Highlight:innovation processes as simultaneous changes in the use and design knowledge embedded in the evolving technology
Highlight:If users innovate, the exchange value of their innovation remains underspecified until manufacturers come into play.
Highlight:forms of contestation characterize the movement of use knowledge between the spheres of producers and users.
Highlight:user–producer interactions: Artifacts move between the spheres of users and producers
Highlight:Producers pick up the use knowledge already embodied in user innovations [68]. The accumulation of use knowledge has been addressed comprehensively in the sphere of users, where user-invented designs and the underlying knowledge are often freely shared
Highlight:We still lack an in-depth understanding of how manufacturers modify user innovations that they deem worth commercializing.
Highlight:Creating use knowledge, therefore, is a task that involves both producers and users.
Highlight:interplay between the uses and users imagined by designers and the real world contexts of use.
Highlight:Cumulative learning takes place through conversion when meaning generated in the private sphere of households is (often unintentionally) shared between households, and thus stabilizes into a publicly shared meaning.
Highlight:innovation processes combine a specific blend of sources of use knowledge when technical objects move within and between the spheres of users and producers. In a diachronic perspective, it therefore becomes questionable whether it makes sense to talk about a user or a manufacturer innovation at all.
Highlight:This paper has started with the question of how challenges in the societal environment of innovation become articulated in processes of technological change

Highlight:the limitations of their own perspectives
Highlight:he role of ICTs in society is not primarily technologically or economically pre-determined, but rather it should be regarded as a product of society.
Highlight:social construction of technology (SCOT)
Highlight:f technology does not emerge from the unfolding of a pre-determined logic or a single determinant,
Sticky notes:what?
Highlight:SCOT perspective stresses that technology development is about making normative choices and thus can be considered to be a form of politics.
Highlight:First of all, if the role and the acceptance of technology are primarily determined by societal forces, this implies that any design trajectory must take into account the social context in which the ICT service or device is going to be used in order to reduce uncertainty and guide the design process. Secondly, this perspective also implies that the manner in which the context of use shapes and re-shapes the meaning of an artifact is difficult to predict at the outset of a design trajectory. Users can re-interpret intended meanings and functionalities in unpredictable ways. And the manner in which the artifact in turn influences this context of use is not predictable either. Thus, we are left with a tension between the increased need to focus on the context in which a technology has to “work,” and the awareness that any claim regarding how a technology will be conceptualized and accepted is clouded in uncertainty. It is in this tension that we are exploring dilemmas and ways of handling them.
Highlight:process of social learning: a process in which knowledge and involvement of users, assessments of future use, and the power relations between disciplines are in a continuous process of critical examination.
Highlight:All three projects were pre-competitive, which means that the developed technology was to be applied and used 5–10 years in the future.
Highlight:user configuration consists of selecting a target group and a context in which a technology will be used and then describing the possible future use of this technology.
Sticky notes:domain analysis
Highlight:the introduction of a new ICT service will influence both the user and the context in which it is going to be used.
Highlight:maybe even fantasies about, possible changes in use that may arise following the introduction of a new technology.
Highlight:project members were inclined to confuse possible futures with desired futures
Sticky notes:I-methodology
Highlight:but as they were asked to think about what the e-buddy could offer them the representatives of the user groups had trouble imagining how they could contribute to the development process. How could they be of any help if they did not understand what a prototype, which was not yet fully developed, could actually do?
Sticky notes:difficult to involve users in innovative software products. Users cannot imagine possible use cases and benefits of innovations
Highlight:Should the requirements play a prescriptive role, serving as pre-conditions when building the application? Or should they be treated as a tool for monitoring and evaluating the process of building the e-buddy?
Highlight:The SCOT perspective showed that there is a tension between not being able to predict future use, but at the same time acknowledging the need to focus on the future context of use in order to evaluate whether new ICTs will be successful.
Highlight:Need to recognize uncertainty
Highlight:In the configuration phase, the dilemma was one of foresight.
Highlight:People concerned with “user-centerd design” advocate this point of view when they talk about designing for a “technologically ignorant” user
Highlight:This starting point rests on the other viewpoint that states that we, by definition, cannot know how users are going to accept and appropriate newly introduced ICTs.
Highlight:It pre-supposes that future use cannot be determined from looking at the past. This perspective advocates creativity in order to be able to anticipate any unexpected kinds of use.
Highlight:. In order to be accepted, any given ICT requires some kind of re-conceptualization by the people who are going to use it.
Highlight:However, in the end, the technology will be exposed to outsiders. Therefore, the fact that users ultimately act as co-producers of the role of the new technology and therefore act as stakeholders in the project has to be taken into account in the early stages of the project.
Sticky notes:ucd
Highlight:The other option, on the right, is based on the combination of the future user and the future technology
Highlight:Here, users have a more passive role, in which they give their comments and discuss the findings and propositions that the researcher or designer comes up with.
Sticky notes:genius design
Highlight:Here, knowledge generation and collectively making the project are the two poles of the dilemma.
Highlight:The laboratory is taken as metaphor for the approach on the left. It functions as a space for reducing and ordering processes that are too complex to be understood in “real life.”
Highlight:When the processes are ordered in the laboratory, they can be translated and reproduced outside
Highlight:paradoxical tension between the need to focus on the future social context of use and the acknowledgment of the unpredictability of the way in which users will accept and appropriate new ICTs.
Sticky notes:base paradox
Highlight:“social shaping” cluster because it reflects a strong belief in the abilities of the end user and his representatives to actively control technology development.
Highlight:Such a belief in the abilities of the users to predict their own behavior and use legitimizes social scientists presenting their findings as relatively stable “facts.”
Highlight:role of researchers is to represent the “voice of the user.”
Highlight:central assumption is that the relation between the user and the ICT technology is determined only when they are confronted by each other.
Sticky notes:user technology
Highlight:Users are perceived as being unpredictable subjects who accept and appropriate technology.
Highlight:Therefore, predictions of future use are hard to make.
Highlight:The ambition of foreseeing future use is abandoned and exchanged for anticipating future use.
Highlight:From this viewpoint, social scientists take a creative role and have the task of coming up with images and narratives concerning possible future uses.

Highlight:not a genuine number at all
Highlight:numbers, statements and proofs of mathematics are mind-dependent
Highlight:Modem physics supports the notions that both space and time are finite, at least in extension, and recent work suggests that it is not implausible to assert that they are finitely divisible also
Highlight:Finitism, in the broadest sense, amounts to a rejection of actual or
Highlight:completed infinite.
Highlight:Finitism may perhaps be best characterised by a denial of the actual, but not necessarily the potential infinite, following the Aristotelian distinction.
Highlight:account of the ontology of number - what it is for a number to count as a number
Highlight:Hilbert's finitist program,
Highlight:The idea is that as long as we can imagine a construction occurring, even if we cannot actually perform it ourselves, we can accept it
Highlight:Strict finitism picks up the problematic notion of 'in principle' possibility, and discards it,
Highlight:Usually, strict finitism requires that one can reliably construct a number, which implies an intuitive understanding of the number.
Highlight:Strict finitism, unlike intuitionism, places a strict limit on the size of a number;
Highlight:the strict finitist will require not only that the number may be physically constructed (i. e. written down in a human lifetime), but also somehow understood by the mathematician
Highlight:mind-dependent
Highlight:This, then, is the fundamental idea of strict finitism: numbers are mind-dependent objects that must be surveyably constructible in practice if they are to count among the legitimate objects of mathematics.
Highlight:strict finitism may be seen as asserting that a number is constructible in practice if and only if it can be written down in a suitable notation, e. g. 'inscribable in Arabic notation'.
Highlight:Instead, the strict finitist suggests that the cap lies precisely where our ordinary intuitive grasp of numbers runs out - where we can no longer clearly think about numbers beyond
Highlight:constructivism is a branch of anti- realism, and that the (strict) finitist will be committed to both

Highlight:'is possible in practice to write down in Arabic notation' for any acceptable number.
Highlight:intuitive connection'
Highlight:'recognisability',
Highlight:The intuitionist will not require that numbers are intuitively recognisable, just that they could be; say, to a sufficiently advanced intellect. So the fact that I may not recognise or be able to work with a number does not mean that it is not possible for it to be recognised or operated with, in principle.
Sticky notes:Intuitionism
Highlight:surveyability'
Highlight:surveyability
Sticky notes:like recognition
Highlight:'weak' finitist
Highlight:To repeat a proof means, not to reproduce the conditions under which a particular result was once obtained, but to repeat every step and the result.
Sticky notes:claim 1: reproduction of the proof
Highlight:he 'force of the proof must be conveyed. A proof is therefore unsurveyable if we cannot see why it 'compels acceptance of the result'.
Sticky notes:claim 2: the proof has to make sense
Highlight:""Arguably, then, three notions of surveyability are in play in Wittgenstein's discussion ... [which] seem to run in an ascending order of strength. If a structure of inferences is too complex or lengthy even to be physically reproduced, then naturally there can be no convincing check of every step in it; and if a physically reproducible structure is nevertheless too lengthy to be checked as a chain of inferences, then obviously it cannot serve as a paradigm of how a certain result cannot but be achieved by correctly following through a certain process. ""'
Sticky notes:claim 3: the proof is coherent
Highlight:then surveyability consists of firstly, the ability to 'reproduce' a proof (i. e. to physically write it down), secondly, the ability to follow each step of the proof, and check that it does not go wrong at some point in reasoning or mathematical calculation, and thirdly, to reach intuitive understanding of why the proof must come out as it does, and thus assert that the proof will always produce this result if correctly carried out.
Sticky notes:all 3 claims together!
Highlight:The first is the simple (constructivist) finite requirement -a proof must consist of a finite number of steps, which may thus be written down.
Highlight:The second is (arguably) required in achieving the third - we will have performed a check of the reasoning in order to accept the outcome.
Highlight:What is suggested by the third requirement is that we achieve intuitive understanding of the proof.
Highlight:his criteria for the surveyability of proofs, as presented here, seems a little ill-fitting when applied to numbers.
Sticky notes:surveyabilty does not work with numbers!
Highlight:What Wittgenstein requires of proofs is that they are understandable - and understandable in the sense that once we understand them, as proofs, we know them; we cannot be mistaken about them. What the strict finitist requires, analogously, of numbers, is that they too are understandable - in the sense that we recognise a string, or arrangement' of numerals as a number
Highlight:'intuitive intelligibility';
Highlight:- particular as the second requirement seems to cover the relations between steps of a proof, and it is not immediately obvious what the 'steps' of a number might be.
Sticky notes:second claim fails with numbers
Highlight:it must be possible to actually write (the numeral for) a number down,
Highlight:For a number to count as intuitively surveyable, we must possess an intuitive understanding of the number and its properties. That is to say, that we must possess a certain direct connection with the number, not definable simply in terms of other smaller numbers (as in the case, presumably, of even relatively simple exponentiation).
Highlight:and assert that the classical finitist, the intuitionist, must be committed to a similar notion of constructibility.
Highlight:A mathematical object is constructible if it is finitely accessible to the mind; that is, its construction consists in a finite mental operation which results in the possession of an intelligible concept - and so a mathematical object is constructible if it is possible (either in principal or in practice) to perform a mental operation which will result in the possession of the appropriate concept, where, as far as Wittgenstein (and the strict finitists in this case) are concerned, full possession of the concept involves a sense of the object being recognisedfor what it IS, in accordance with Wittgenstein's third requirement.
Highlight:numbers are mind-dependent,
Highlight:intuitive intelligibility'
Highlight:One problem remains largely unanswered, however - and that is the question over how surveyability is related to the notation employed. Does more sophisticated notation lead to an increase in surveyability? Is surveyability, after all, dependent upon notation?
Sticky notes:problem of surveyability
Highlight:one might stick rigidly to the criteria outlined in the previous chapter, and require an intuitive grasp of numbers, independent of the notation used to represent them.
Highlight:here is to simply embrace the distinction between differing notations, and allow various limits on the surveyability of numbers, dependent upon notation.
Highlight:he suggestion that 15 is harder to survey than 4, say, and that 386 is harder than 41, seems to be true, and not just coincidentally. The more numerals involved, the longer it takes us to take in (or even just observe) the arrangement, and surely this simple fact must be a factor
Highlight:What Van Dantzig suggests is that the meaning of the term 'natural number' has changed in this case
Highlight:While Van Dantzig is here addressing the question of whether 1010""' is afinite number, what he says may be equally well
Highlight:surveyability has different senses; numbers surveyable in Arabic notation are surveyablel, whereas those surveyable in (only) exponential (or 'higher') notation, are surveyable4 (following Van Dantzig's identification of the different sets corresponding to the successive senses

A good persona is a narrative that describes a person's typical day and experiences, as well as skills, attitude, background, environment, and goals. Personas identify the person's motivations, expectations, aspirations and behaviors.
Highlight:They help take focus away from requirements and deliverables so designers can focus on the user's goals. Personas give a name, face, and narrative to the ""user"" for whom you are designing; they make the concept of the user into an actual person with opinions, feelings and a voice.

Highlight:he benefits are seen as ranging from increasing the focus on users and their needs, to being an effective communication tool, to having direct design influence, such as leading to better design decisions and defining the product’s feature set
Highlight:<p>The special aspect of a persona description is that you do not look at the entire person, but use the area of focus or domain you are working within as a lens to highlight the relevant attitudes and the specific context associated with the area of work.</p>

Highlight:The persona approach stems from IT system development where in the late 1990s many researchers had begun reflecting on how you could communicate an understanding of the users
Highlight:engaging perspective that I myself use, which emphasizes how the story can engage the reader
Highlight:he purpose of the engaging perspective is to move from designers seeing the user as a stereotype with whom they are unable to identify and whose life they cannot envision, to designers actively involving themselves in the lives of the personas.
Highlight:Ad hoc personas are based on the designers’ intuition and experience and used to create an empathetic focus in the design process (Norman, 2004)
Highlight:f the design team members have a number of persona descriptions in front of them while designing, the personas will help them maintain the perspective of the users
Highlight:the actual purpose of the method is not the persona descriptions, but the ability to imagine the product

Lush light floods the room, birds chatter. It is only 6:30 o'clock in the morning, but I feel well-rested and alive; time to get up, to brew some coffee. Are you jealous of my morning routine? Were you startled out of your sleep by a merciless alarm clock? Was it dark outside, no birds around, and did you feel groggy and bleary-eyed?
Highlight:The question is whether we can create technology which understands the crucial features of sunrise and birds and which succeeds in delivering a similar experience, even when the sun refuses to shine and the birds have already left for Africa.
Highlight:surrogate experience
Highlight:In fact, studies show that <em>experiential</em> purchases (i.e., the acquisition of an event to live through, such as a concert, a dinner, a journey) make people more happy than <em>material</em> purchases
Highlight:They transform into highly individual <em>Experience Societies</em> (Schulze 1992; Schulze 2005) whose members equate happiness with the acquisition of positive life events.
Highlight:we now witness a version of the <em>Experience Society</em> which favours meaningful engagement to earning money and begins to dissociate experience and expenditure.
Highlight:Admittedly, to develop a post-materialistic (i.e., experiential) orientation may require sufficient food, clothing, and shelter (Inglehart 1997; Maslow 1954)
Highlight:But the missing willingness to pay for music in the form of a tangible product may also be a consequence of shifting from a materialistic to an experiential orientation.
Highlight:I primarily focus on experiences as meaningful, personally encountered events (in German: ""Erlebnis"") and not so much on the knowledge gained through these events (in German: ""Erfahrung"")
Highlight:orlizzi and Battarbee 2004;
Highlight:Psychologically, an experience emerges from the integration of perception, action, motivation, and cognition into an inseparable, meaningful whole.
Highlight:""an episode, a chunk of time that one went through [...] sights and sounds, feelings and thoughts, motives and actions [...] closely knitted together, stored in memory, labelled, relived and communicated to others. An experience is a story, emerging from the dialogue of a person with her or his world through action""
Highlight:While an experience is a complex fabric of feelings, thoughts, and actions, I believe emotions and fulfilment of universal psychological needs to have an accentuated role.
Highlight:Things are not the opposite of experiences, but create and substantially shape them.
Highlight:But even the post-materialist's experience is most of the time mediated.
Sticky notes:open for discussion!
Highlight:it is ultimately experiences we are designing, not things.
Highlight:The post-materialistic interactive product is, thus, not so much a tangible object, but a story transported or told through an object - a ""material tale"" or ""psychosocial narrative"". Dunne (2006, p. 69) explains: ""[... B]ehavior is a narrative experience arising from the interaction between our desire to act through products and the social and behavioural limitations imposed [...] through [their] conceptual models.""
Highlight:He quotes Christiaan Virant, one of the creators of the <em>Buddha Machine</em>: ""That's the beauty of the Buddha Machine, it's really ... serendipity.""
Highlight:The <em>Buddha Machine</em> is an excellent example of a full-blown post-materialistic device.
Highlight:The <em>Why</em>, <em>What</em> and <em>How</em> level.
Highlight:The <em>What</em> addresses the things people can do through an interactive product, such as ""making a telephone call,""
Highlight:The <em>How</em> is even more tied to the actual object to be designed and its context of use.
Highlight:The <em>How</em> is the typical realm of the interaction designer: to make given functionality accessible in an aesthetically pleasing way.
Highlight:This view ignores peoples' actual motivation to use a product. For the couple being separated, the SMS was not primarily an SMS, it was a love message, a way to fulfil their need for relatedness.
Highlight:Telephone calls are not only - technologically speaking - telephone calls.
Highlight:In reality, they are the glorious beginning or the sad end of a close relationship, a surrogate good-night kiss, an act of support, a way to kill time, or a pizza order.
Highlight:It starts from the <em>Why</em>, tries to clarify the needs and emotions involved in an activity, the meaning, the experience.
Highlight:we still need all the wonderful technologies, dreamt up by engineers and computer scientists all over the world. But they are only materials - canvas, colours, and brushes - for the <em>Experience Designer</em>.

Therefore, uncertainty always accompanies the process to a greater or lesser degree.
Highlight:browsing consists of a series of glimpses, some glimpses leading to further, closer exploration of the thing(s) glimpsed and some not.  In this view, browsing consists of numerous stops and starts, with some reading, or surveying, alternating with other actions, such as sampling and selecting.

Highlight:Each sub-system is managed by one or more members of the crew.
Highlight:We know how many crew members a sub-system requires at least to keep working. Another important information we know about each sub-system is it's manufacturer. We can model the manufacturer for the means of this simulation as a String.
Highlight:We know from the crew members their age and that they are trained by one or more manufacturer before joining a ship
Highlight:here, crew members learn to handle the sub-systems of the manufacturer that formed them. Additionally, crew members can learn to handle speci c sub-systems when they are in the ship
Highlight:For example, crew member Spock lives in spaceship SZ-141 and was formed by manufacturers Acme, Beta and Omega. He also learnt from his experience in the ship how to handle the refrigeration sub-system. Then, Spock knows how to handle all sub-systems from manufacturers Acme, Beta and Omega and also the refrigeration sub-system of the ship.
Highlight:They can be, however, not assigned to any sub-system. We need to be able to assign a free crew member to a sub-system, re-assign it from a sub-system to another sub-system and un-assign him.

Highlight:Each maneuver is limited to work with attacks from certain manufacturers, and has an associated a ectiveness level that is measured in points.
Highlight:A maneuver avoids an attack from a device if the pursuit points of the attacker device are less that the e ectiveness level of the maneuver, and also the manufacturer of the attack is one of the manufacturers that the maneuver can handle. A ship can avoid an attack if at least one of its maneuvers can avoid the attack. If that happens, the ship does not receive any damage from the attack.

Highlight:When Anonymous hacked the State Department Web site on February 17th, they declared, “Aaron Swartz this is for you.”
Highlight:Prose creates a strong illusion of presence—so strong that it is difficult to destroy it.
Highlight:It is hard to remember that you are reading and not hearing. The illusion is stronger when the prose is online, partly because you are aware that it might be altered or redacted at any moment—the writer may be online, too, as you read it—and partly because the Internet has been around for such a short time that we implicitly assume (as we do not with a book) that the writer of a blog post is alive.
Highlight:Having power over other people made you into something he disdained. Being a boss wasn’t just immoral; bosses were stupid.
Highlight:Most people, it seems, stretch the truth to make themselves seem more impressive. I, it seems, stretch the truth to make myself look worse.
Highlight:when [redacted] asked me why I switched from computer science to sociology, I said it was because Computer Science was hard and I wasn’t really good at it, which really isn’t true at all. The real reason is because I want to save the world. Maybe I didn’t say that because it sounds sort of crazy.

Highlight:e.g [26, 33, 43, 46, 47, 51, 63])
Highlight:The research area of lifelogging and personal informatics aims to provide tools that help to capture data about one’s personal life in order to keep a record of the past.
Highlight:While initially designed as a system for personal recall, the MyLifeBits system was later used and studied as an authoring tool for storytelling [27]
Highlight:These systems visualize personal data from a wide range of sources (e.g. from sensors for one’s sleep cycle [4], movement [32, 59], logs of computer usage [3], music listening histories [5, 6], as well as communication logs [29, 66])

Sticky notes:Searching as a life long activity.
Highlight:Kuhlthau (1991) proposed a linear model that describes information seeking as a progression of stages for the information seeker’s feelings, thoughts, and actions. In an information search process, a person starts out with vague thoughts and feelings of uncertainty, and then moves towards clearer, more focused thoughts and feelings of confidence and satisfaction.
Sticky notes:cognitive model of information seeking process. 
Highlight:Kuhlthau highlights a conceptual mismatch between a person’s information problems (“uncertainty and confusion”) and a system’s view of information (“certainty and order”).
Sticky notes:negative interpretation of information need!
Highlight:Foster (2004) proposes a non-linear model of information seeking that captures three interrelated cognitive approaches: opening, orientation, and consolidation.
Highlight:An important aspect of information seeking is having a sense of orientation (i.e., where one is, and where one seeks to go next).
Highlight:A diary study on email, file, and Web search revealed orienteering as an information seeking style in its own right that includes small situated steps toward a target (Teevan et al., 2004).
Sticky notes:users prefer small situated steps towards a target over teleporting
Highlight:Exploratory search is an attempt to broaden information seeking from simple lookup towards knowledge building (Marchionini, 2006), aiming to support “users [to] explore, overcome uncertainty, and learn” (White et al., 2006)

"An Informal Information-Seeking Environment.pdf","https://www.diigo.com/item/pdf/5j1yj/604e","information-seeking","When an opportunistic searcher encounters an over-determined information system, less than ideal search strategies often ensue. The mismatch can be addressed by reducing the determinacy of the system, thereby mak-
ing it more amenable to informal problem-solving prac-
tices. This claim is investigated by designing an informa-
tion-seeking environment, where search techniques are
represented with a data-flow notation and where the
searcher has control of layout; thus, to seek information,
is to manage space. Search plans can be represented
on the display, and perceptual cues about search prog-
ress are captured while searching. With elements of
search activity visible, opportunistic problem-solving
should be well supported. The interface is designed to
be extensible so a wide range of search techniques can
be represented, and emphasizes search material, such
as queries, results, and notes, rather than system con-
trols.","","","2016-01-20 10:52:15"
"The Perfect Search Engine Is Not Enough: A Study of Orienteering Behavior in Directed Search.pdf","https://www.diigo.com/item/pdf/5j1yj/40yv","information-seeking","This paper presents a modified diary study that investigated how people performed personally motivated searches in their email, in their files, and on the Web. Although earlier studies of directed search focused on keyword search, most of the search behavior we observed did not involve keyword search. Instead of jumping directly to theirinformation target
using keywords, our participants navigated to their target with small, local steps using their contextual knowledge as a guide, even when they knew exactly what they were looking for in advance. This stepping behavior was especially common for participants with unstructured information organization. The observed advantages of searching by taking small steps include that it allowed users to specify less of their information need and provided a context in which to understand their results. We discuss the implications of such advantages for the design of personal information management tools.","","","2016-01-20 10:49:32"
